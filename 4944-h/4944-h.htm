v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> those who are invited to pay a
visit to Beechcroft, there are some who, honestly acknowledging
that amusement is their object, will be content to feel with
Lilias, conjecture with Jane, and get into scrapes with Phyllis,
without troubling themselves to extract any moral from their
proceedings; and to these the Mohun family would only apologise
for having led a very humdrum life during the eighteen months
spent in their company.</p>
<p>There may, however, be more unreasonable visitors, who,
professing only to come as parents and guardians, expect
entertainment for themselves, as well as instruction for those
who had rather it was out of sight,&mdash;look for antiques in
carved cherry-stones,&mdash;and require plot, incident, and
catastrophe in a chronicle of small beer.</p>
<p>To these the Mohuns beg respectfully to observe, that they
hope their examples may not be altogether <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>devoid of
indirect instruction; and lest it should be supposed that they
lived without object, aim, or principle, they would observe that
the maxim which has influenced the delineation of the different
<i>Scenes and Characters</i> is, that feeling, unguided and
unrestrained, soon becomes mere selfishness; while the simple
endeavour to fulfil each immediate claim of duty may lead to the
highest acts of self-devotion.</p>

<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>PREFACE (1886)</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> this book is an instance to
be adduced in support of the advice I have often given to young
authors&mdash;not to print before they themselves are old enough
to do justice to their freshest ideas.</p>
<p>Not that I can lay claim to its being a production of tender
and interesting youth.&nbsp; It was my second actual publication,
and I believe I was of age before it appeared&mdash;but I see now
the failures that more experience might have enabled me to avoid;
and I would not again have given it to the world if the same
characters recurring in another story had not excited a certain
desire to see their first start.</p>
<p>In fact they have been more or less my life-long
companions.&nbsp; An almost solitary child, with periodical
visits to the Elysium of a large family, it was natural to dream
of other children and their ways and sports till they became
almost realities.&nbsp; They took shape when my French master set
me to write letters for him.&nbsp; The letters gradually became
conversation and <a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>narrative, and the adventures of the family sweetened
the toils of French composition.&nbsp; In the exigencies of
village school building in those days gone by, before in every
place</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It there behoved him to set up the standard
of her Grace,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the tale was actually printed for private sale, as a link
between translations of short stories.</p>
<p>This process only stifled the family in my imagination for a
time.&nbsp; They awoke once more with new names, but
substantially the same, and were my companions in many a solitary
walk, the results of which were scribbled down in leisure moments
to be poured into my mother&rsquo;s ever patient and sympathetic
ears.</p>
<p>And then came the impulse to literature for young people given
by the example of that memorable book the <i>Fairy Bower</i>, and
followed up by <i>Amy Herbert</i>.&nbsp; It was felt that elder
children needed something of a deeper tone than the Edgeworthian
style, yet less directly religious than the Sherwood class of
books; and on that wave of opinion, my little craft floated out
into the great sea of the public.</p>
<p>Friends, whose kindness astonished me, and fills me with
gratitude when I look back on it, gave me seasonable criticism
and pruning, and finally launched me.&nbsp; My heroes and
heroines had arranged themselves so as to work out a definite
principle, and this was enough for us all.</p>
<p><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>Children&rsquo;s books had not been supposed to require
a plot.&nbsp; Miss Edgeworth&rsquo;s, which I still continue to
think gems in their own line, are made chronicles, or, more
truly, illustrations of various truths worked out upon the same
personages.&nbsp; Moreover, the skill of a Jane Austen or a Mrs.
Gaskell is required to produce a perfect plot without doing
violence to the ordinary events of an every-day life.&nbsp; It is
all a matter of arrangement.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell can make a
perfect little plot out of a sick lad and a canary bird; and
another can do nothing with half a dozen murders and an
explosion; and of arranging my materials so as to build up a
story, I was quite incapable.&nbsp; It is still my great
deficiency; but in those days I did not even understand that the
attempt was desirable.&nbsp; Criticism was a more thorough thing
in those times than it has since become through the multiplicity
of books to be hurried over, and it was often very useful, as
when it taught that such arrangement of incident was the means of
developing the leading idea.</p>
<p>Yet, with all its faults, the children, who had been real to
me, caught, chiefly by the youthful sense of fun and enjoyment,
the attention of other children; and the curious semi-belief one
has in the phantoms of one&rsquo;s brain made me dwell on their
after life and share my discoveries with my friends, not,
however, writing them down till after the lapse of all these
years the <a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>tenderness inspired by associations of early days led to
taking up once more the old characters in <i>The Two Sides of the
Shield</i>; and the kind welcome this has met with has led to the
resuscitation of the crude and inexperienced tale which never
pretended to be more than a mere family chronicle.</p>

I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ELDER SISTER</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Return, and in the daily round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of duty and of love,<br />
Thou best wilt find that patient faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That lifts the soul above.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Eleanor Mohun</span> was the eldest child
of a gentleman of old family, and good property, who had married
the sister of his friend and neighbour, the Marquis of
Rotherwood.&nbsp; The first years of her life were marked by few
events.&nbsp; She was a quiet, steady, useful girl, finding her
chief pleasure in nursing and teaching her brothers and sisters,
and her chief annoyance in her mamma&rsquo;s attempts to make her
a fine lady; but before she had reached her nineteenth year she
had learnt to know real anxiety and sorrow.&nbsp; Her mother,
after suffering much from grief at the loss of her two brothers,
fell into so alarming a state of health, that her husband was
obliged immediately to hurry her away to Italy, leaving the
younger children under the care of a governess, and the elder
boys at school, while Eleanor alone accompanied them.</p>
<p>Their absence lasted nearly three years, and during the last
winter, an engagement commenced between Eleanor and Mr. Francis
Hawkesworth, rather to the surprise of Lady Emily, who wondered
that he had been able to discover the real worth veiled beneath a
formal and retiring manner, and to admire features which, though
regular, had a want of light and animation, which diminished
their beauty even more than the thinness and compression of the
lips, and the very pale gray of the eyes.</p>
<p>The family were about to return to England, where the marriage
was to take place, when Lady Emily was attacked with a sudden
illness, which her weakened frame was unable to resist, and in a
very few days she died, leaving the little Adeline, about eight
months old, to accompany her father and sister on their
melancholy journey homewards.&nbsp; This loss made a great change
in the views of Eleanor, who, as she considered the cares and
annoyances which would fall on her father, when left to bear the
whole burthen of the management of the children and household,
felt it was her duty to give up her own prospects of happiness,
and to remain at home.&nbsp; How could she leave the tender
little ones to the care of servants&mdash;trust her sisters to a
governess, and make her brothers&rsquo; home yet more
dreary?&nbsp; She knew her father to be strong in sense and firm
in judgment, but indolent, indulgent, and inattentive to details,
and she could not bear to leave him to be harassed by the petty
cares of a numerous family, especially when broken in spirits and
weighed down with sorrow.&nbsp; She thought her duty was plain,
and, accordingly, she wrote to Mr. Hawkesworth, to beg him to
allow her to withdraw her promise.</p>
<p>Her brother Henry was the only person who knew what she had
done, and he alone perceived something of tremulousness about her
in the midst of the even cheerfulness with which she had from the
first supported her father&rsquo;s spirits.&nbsp; Mr. Mohun,
however, did not long remain in ignorance, for Frank Hawkesworth
himself arrived at Beechcroft to plead his cause with
Eleanor.&nbsp; He knew her value too well to give her up, and Mr.
Mohun would not hear of her making such a sacrifice for his
sake.&nbsp; But Eleanor was also firm, and after weeks of
unhappiness and uncertainty, it was at length arranged that she
should remain at home till Emily was old enough to take her
place, and that Frank should then return from India and claim his
bride.</p>
<p>Well did she discharge the duties which she had undertaken;
she kept her father&rsquo;s mind at ease, followed out his views,
managed the boys with discretion and gentleness, and made her
sisters well-informed and accomplished girls; but, for want of
fully understanding the characters of her two next sisters, Emily
and Lilias, she made some mistakes with regard to them.&nbsp; The
clouds of sorrow, to her so dark and heavy, had been to them but
morning mists, and the four years which had changed her from a
happy girl into a thoughtful, anxious woman, had brought them to
an age which, if it is full of the follies of childhood, also
partakes of the earnestness of youth; an age when deep
foundations of enduring confidence may be laid by one who can
enter into and direct the deeper flow of mind and feeling which
lurks hid beneath the freaks and fancies of the early years of
girlhood.&nbsp; But Eleanor had little sympathy for freaks and
fancies.&nbsp; She knew the realities of life too well to build
airy castles with younger and gayer spirits; her sisters&rsquo;
romance seemed to her dangerous folly, and their lively nonsense
levity and frivolity.&nbsp; They were too childish to share in
her confidence, and she was too busy and too much preoccupied to
have ear or mind for visionary trifles, though to trifles of real
life she paid no small degree of attention.</p>
<p>It might have been otherwise had Henry Mohun lived; but in the
midst of the affection of all who knew him, honour from those who
could appreciate his noble character, and triumphs gained by his
uncommon talents, he was cut off by a short illness, when not
quite nineteen, a most grievous loss to his family, and above
all, to Eleanor.&nbsp; Unlike her, as he was joyous,
high-spirited, full of fun, and overflowing with imagination and
poetry, there was a very close bond of union between them, in the
strong sense of duty, the firmness of purpose, and energy of mind
which both possessed, and which made Eleanor feel perfect
reliance on him, and look up to him with earnest
admiration.&nbsp; With him alone she was unreserved; he was the
only person who could ever make her show a spark of liveliness,
and on his death, it was only with the most painful efforts that
she could maintain her composed demeanour and fulfil her daily
duties.&nbsp; Years passed on, and still she felt the blank which
Harry had left, almost as much as the first day that she heard of
his death, but she never spoke of him, and to her sisters it
seemed as if he was forgotten.&nbsp; The reserve which had begun
to thaw under his influence, again returning, placed her a still
greater distance from the younger girls, and unconsciously she
became still more of a governess and less of a sister.&nbsp;
Little did she know of the &lsquo;blissful dreams in secret
shared&rsquo; between Emily, Lilias, and their brother Claude,
and little did she perceive the danger that Lilias would be run
away with by a lively imagination, repressed and starved, but
entirely untrained.</p>
<p>Whatever influenced Lilias, had, through her, nearly the same
effect upon Emily, a gentle girl, easily led, especially by
Lilias, whom she regarded with the fondest affection and
admiration.&nbsp; The perils of fancy and romance were not,
however, to be dreaded for Jane, the fourth sister, a strong
resemblance of Eleanor in her clear common sense, love of
neatness, and active usefulness; but there were other dangers for
her, in her tendency to faults, which, under wise training, had
not yet developed themselves.</p>
<p>Such were the three girls who were now left to assist each
other in the management of the household, and who looked forward
to their new offices with the various sensations of pleasure,
anxiety, self-importance, and self-mistrust, suited to their
differing characters, and to the ages of eighteen, sixteen, and
fourteen.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>CHAPTER
II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE NEW COURT</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Just at the age &rsquo;twixt boy and
youth,<br />
When thought is speech, and speech is truth.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> long-delayed wedding took place
on the 13th of January, 1845, and the bride and bridegroom
immediately departed for a year&rsquo;s visit among Mr.
Hawkesworth&rsquo;s relations in Northumberland, whence they were
to return to Beechcroft, merely for a farewell, before sailing
for India.</p>
<p>It was half-past nine in the evening, and the wedding
over&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Hawkesworth gone, and the guests
departed, the drawing-room had returned to its usual state.&nbsp;
It was a very large room, so spacious that it would have been
waste and desolate, had it not been well filled with handsome,
but heavy old-fashioned furniture, covered with crimson damask,
and one side of the room fitted up with a bookcase, so high that
there was a spiral flight of library steps to give access to the
upper shelves.&nbsp; Opposite were four large windows, now hidden
by their ample curtains; and near them was at one end of the room
a piano, at the other a drawing-desk.&nbsp; The walls were
wainscoted with polished black oak, the panels reflecting the red
fire-light like mirrors.&nbsp; Over the chimney-piece hung a
portrait, by Vandyke, of a pale, dark cavalier, of noble mien,
and with arched eyebrows, called by Lilias, in defiance of dates,
by the name of Sir Maurice de Mohun, the hero of the family, and
allowed by every one to be a striking likeness of Claude, the
youth who at that moment lay, extending a somewhat superfluous
length of limb upon the sofa, which was placed commodiously at
right angles to the fire.</p>
<p>The other side of the fire was Mr. Mohun&rsquo;s special
domain, and there he sat at his writing-table, abstracted by
deafness and letter writing, from the various sounds of mirth and
nonsense, which proceeded from the party round the long narrow
sofa table, which they had drawn across the front of the fire,
leaving the large round centre table in darkness and
oblivion.</p>
<p>This party had within the last half hour been somewhat
thinned; the three younger girls had gone to bed, the Rector of
Beechcroft, Mr. Robert Devereux, had been called home to attend
some parish business, and there remained Emily and
Lilias&mdash;tall graceful girls, with soft hazel eyes, clear
dark complexions, and a quantity of long brown curls.&nbsp; The
latter was busily completing a guard for the watch, which Mr.
Hawkesworth had presented to Reginald, a fine handsome boy of
eleven, who, with his elbows on the table, sat contemplating her
progress, and sometimes teasing his brother Maurice, who was
earnestly engaged in constructing a model with some cards, which
he had pilfered from the heap before Emily.&nbsp; She was putting
her sister&rsquo;s wedding cards into their shining envelopes,
and directing them in readiness for the post the next morning,
while they were sealed by a youth of the same age as Claude, a
small slim figure, with light complexion and hair, and dark gray
eyes full of brightness and vivacity.</p>
<p>He was standing, so as to be more on a level with the high
candle, and as Emily&rsquo;s writing was not quite so rapid as
his sealing, he amused himself in the intervals with burning his
own fingers, by twisting the wax into odd shapes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you not seal up his eyes?&rsquo; inquired
Reginald, with an arch glance towards his brother on the
sofa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do it yourself, you rogue,&rsquo; was the answer, at
the same time approaching with the hot sealing-wax in his
hand&mdash;a demonstration which occasioned Claude to open his
eyes very wide, without giving himself any further trouble about
the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;now they try to look
innocent, as if no one could hear them plotting
mischief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Them! it was not!&mdash;Redgie there&mdash;young
ladies&mdash;I appeal&mdash;was not I as
innocent?&rsquo;&mdash;was the very rapid, incoherent, and
indistinct answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After so lucid and connected a justification, no more
can be said,&rsquo; replied Claude, in a kind of &lsquo;leave me,
leave me to repose&rsquo; tone, which occasioned Lilias to say,
&lsquo;I am afraid you are very tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tired! what has he done to tire him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure a wedding is a terrible wear of
spirits!&rsquo; said Emily&mdash;&lsquo;such
excitement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;when I give a spectacle to the family next
year, I mean to tire you to some purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, looking up, &lsquo;is
Rotherwood&rsquo;s wedding to be the next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ought to understand, uncle,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood, making two stops towards him, and speaking a little
more clearly, &lsquo;I thought you longed to get rid of your
nephew and his concerns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You idle boy!&rsquo; returned Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;you do
not mean to have the impertinence to come of age next
year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As much as having been born on the 30th of July, 1825,
can make me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what good will your coming of age do us?&rsquo;
said Lilias, &lsquo;you will be in London or Brighton, or some
such stupid place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not be senseless, Lily,&rsquo; returned her
cousin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Devereux Castle is to be in
splendour&mdash;Hetherington in amazement&mdash;the
county&rsquo;s hair shall stand on end&mdash;illuminations,
bonfires, feasts, balls, colours flying, bands playing, tenants
dining, fireworks&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hurrah! jolly! jolly!&rsquo; shouted Reginald, dancing
on the ottoman, &lsquo;and mind there are lots of
squibs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that Master Reginald Mohun has a new cap and bells
for the occasion,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me make some fireworks,&rsquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will begin like a noble baron of the hospitable
olden time,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be like the old days, when every birthday of
yours was a happy day for the people at Hetherington,&rsquo; said
Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! those were happy old days,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood, in a graver tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are happy days, are not they?&rsquo; said Lily,
smiling.</p>
<p>Her cousin answered with a sigh, &lsquo;Yes, but you do not
remember the old ones, Lily;&rsquo; then, after a pause, he
added, &lsquo;It was a grievous mistake to shut up the castle all
these years.&nbsp; We have lost sight of everybody.&nbsp; I do
not even know what has become of the Aylmers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They went to live in London,&rsquo; said Emily,
&lsquo;Aunt Robert used to write to them there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know, I know, but where are they now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In London, I should think,&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Some one said Miss Aylmer was gone out as a
governess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; I wish I could hear more!&nbsp; Poor Mr.
Aylmer!&nbsp; He was the first man who tried to teach me
Latin.&nbsp; I wonder what has become of that mad fellow Edward,
and Devereux, my father&rsquo;s godson!&nbsp; Was not Mrs. Aylmer
badly off?&nbsp; I cannot bear that people should be
forgotten!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not so very long that we have lost sight of
them,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eight years,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He died six weeks after my father.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I
have made my mother promise to come home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really?&rsquo; said Lilias, &lsquo;she has been coming
so often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye&mdash;but she is coming this time.&nbsp; She is to
spend the winter at the castle, and make acquaintance with all
the neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His lordship is romancing,&rsquo; said Claude to Lily
in a confidential tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll punish you for suspecting me of talking
hyperborean language&mdash;hyperbolical, I mean,&rsquo; cried
Lord Rotherwood; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make you dance the Polka with
all the beauty and fashion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I shall stay at Oxford till it is over,&rsquo;
said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not know what a treasure you will be,&rsquo;
said the Marquis, &lsquo;ladies like nothing so well as dancing
with a fellow twice the height he should be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beware of putting me forward,&rsquo; said Claude,
rising, and, as he leant against the chimney-piece, looking down
from his height of six feet three, with a patronising air upon
his cousin, &lsquo;I shall be taken for the hero, and you for my
little brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I was,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood, &lsquo;it
would be much better fun.&nbsp; I should escape the speechifying,
the worst part of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;for one whose speeches
will be scraps of three words each, strung together with the
burthen of the apprentices&rsquo; song, Radara tadara,
tandore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Radaratade,&rsquo; said the Marquis, laughing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;By the bye, if Eleanor and Frank Hawkesworth manage well,
they may be here in time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they are so devoted to gaiety?&rsquo; said
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will say next that William is coming
from Canada, on purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That tall captain!&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He used to be a very awful person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! he used to keep the spoilt Marquis in order,&rsquo;
said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To say nothing of the spoilt Claude,&rsquo; returned
Lord Rotherwood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Claude never was spoilt,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not Eleanor&rsquo;s way,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At least she cannot be accused of spoiling me,&rsquo;
said Lord Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall never dare to write at
that round table again&mdash;her figure will occupy the chair
like Banquo&rsquo;s ghost, and wave me off with a knitting
needle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! that stain of ink was a worse blot on your
character than on the new table cover,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was rigidly impartial,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;she made exceptions in
favour of Ada and me.&nbsp; She left the spoiling of the rest to
Emily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And well Emily will perform it!&nbsp; A pretty state
you will be in by the 30th of July, 1846,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should not Emily make as good a duenna as
Eleanor?&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should she not?&nbsp; She will not&mdash;that is
all,&rsquo; said the Marquis.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such slow people you
all are!&nbsp; You would all go to sleep if I did not sometimes
rouse you up a little&mdash;grow stagnant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not an elegant comparison,&rsquo; said Lilias;
&lsquo;besides, you must remember that your hasty brawling
streams do not reflect like tranquil lakes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of Lily&rsquo;s poetical hits, I declare!&rsquo;
said Lord Rotherwood, &lsquo;but she need not have taken
offence&mdash;I did not refer to her&mdash;only Claude and Emily,
and perhaps&mdash;no, I will not say who else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, Rotherwood, I will tell you what I am&mdash;the
Lily that derives all its support from the calm lake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, Lily, worthy of yourself,&rsquo; cried Lord
Rotherwood, laughing, &lsquo;but you know I am always off when
you talk poetry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suspect it is time for us all to be off,&rsquo; said
Claude, &lsquo;did I not hear it strike the quarter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to-morrow I shall be off in earnest,&rsquo; said
Lord Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;Half way to London before Claude
has given one turn to &ldquo;his sides, and his shoulders, and
his heavy head.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we see you at Easter?&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I do not think you will.&nbsp; I am engaged to stay
with somebody somewhere, I forget the name of place and man;
besides, Grosvenor Square is more tolerable then than at any
other time of the year, and I shall spend a fortnight with my
mother and Florence.&nbsp; It is after Easter that you come to
Oxford, is it not, Claude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my year of idleness will be over.&nbsp; And there
is the Baron looking at his watch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Baron&rsquo; was the title by which the young
people were wont to distinguish Mr. Mohun, who, as Lily believed,
had a right to the title of Baron of Beechcroft.&nbsp; It was
certain that he was the representative of a family which had been
settled at Beechcroft ever since the Norman Conquest, and Lily
was very proud of the name of Sir William de Moune in the battle
roll, and of Sir John among the first Knights of the
Garter.&nbsp; Her favourite was Sir Maurice, who had held out
Beechcroft Court for six weeks against the Roundheads, and had
seen the greater part of the walls battered down.&nbsp; Witnesses
of the strength of the old castle yet remained in the massive
walls and broad green ramparts, which enclosed what was now
orchard and farm-yard, and was called the Old Court, while the
dwelling-house, built by Sir Maurice after the Restoration, was
named the New Court.&nbsp; Sir Maurice had lost many an acre in
the cause of King Charles, and his new mansion was better suited
to the honest squires who succeeded him, than to the mighty
barons his ancestors.&nbsp; It was substantial and well built,
with a square gravelled court in front, and great, solid, folding
gates opening into a lane, bordered with very tall well-clipped
holly hedges, forming a polished, green, prickly wall.&nbsp;
There was a little door in one of these gates, which was scarcely
ever shut, from whence a well-worn path led to the porch, where
generally reposed a huge Newfoundland dog, guardian of the hoops
and walkingsticks that occupied the corners.&nbsp; The front door
was of heavy substantial oak, studded with nails, and never
closed in the daytime, and the hall, wainscoted and floored with
slippery oak, had a noble open fireplace, with a wood fire
burning on the hearth.</p>
<p>On the other side of the house was a terrace sloping down to a
lawn and bowling-green, hedged in by a formal row of
evergreens.&nbsp; A noble plane-tree was in the middle of the
lawn, and beyond it a pond renowned for water-lilies.&nbsp; To
the left was the kitchen garden, terminating in an orchard,
planted on the ramparts and moat of the Old Court; then came the
farm buildings, and beyond them a field, sloping upwards to an
extensive wood called Beechcroft Park.&nbsp; In the wood was the
cottage of Walter Greenwood, gamekeeper and woodman by hereditary
succession, but able and willing to turn his hand to anything,
and, in fact, as Adeline once elegantly termed him, the
&lsquo;family tee totum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the right of the house there was a field, called Long Acre,
bounded on the other side by the turnpike road to Raynham, which
led up the hill to the village green, surrounded by well-kept
cottages and gardens.&nbsp; The principal part of the village
was, however, at the foot of the hill, where the Court lane
crossed the road, led to the old church, the school, and
parsonage, in its little garden, shut in by thick yew
hedges.&nbsp; Beyond was the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, more
cottages, and Mrs. Appleton&rsquo;s wondrous village warehouse;
and the lane, after passing by the handsome old farmhouse of Mr.
Harrington, Mr. Mohun&rsquo;s principal tenant, led to a bridge
across a clear trout stream, the boundary of the parish of
Beechcroft.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE NEW PRINCIPLE</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And wilt thou show no more, quoth he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than doth thy duty bind?<br />
I well perceive thy love is small.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the Sunday evening which
followed Eleanor&rsquo;s wedding, Lilias was sitting next to
Emily, and talking in very earnest tones, which after a time
occasioned Claude to look up and say, &lsquo;What is all this
about?&nbsp; Something remarkably absurd I suspect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a new principle,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;New!&rsquo; cried Lily, &lsquo;only what must be the
feeling of every person of any warmth of character?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now for it then,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Claude, I really mean it (and Lily sincerely
thought she did).&nbsp; I will not tell you if you are going to
laugh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That depends upon what your principle may chance to
be,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is it, Emily?&nbsp; She
will be much obliged to you for telling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She only says she cannot bear people to do their duty,
and not to act from a feeling of love,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not fair,&rsquo; returned Lily, &lsquo;all I
say is, that it is better that people should act upon love for
its own sake, than upon duty for its own sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What comes in rhyme with Lily?&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be tiresome, Claude, I really want you to
understand me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait till you understand yourself,&rsquo; said the
provoking brother, &lsquo;and let me finish what I am
reading.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For about a quarter of an hour he was left in peace, while
Lily was busily employed with a pencil and paper, under the
shadow of a book, and at length laid before him the following
verses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;What is the source of gentleness,<br />
The spring of human blessedness,<br />
Bringing the wounded spirit healing,<br />
The comforts high of heaven revealing,<br />
The lightener of each daily care,<br />
The wing of hope, the life of prayer,<br />
The zest of joy, the balm of sorrow,<br />
Bliss of to-day, hope of to-morrow,<br />
The glory of the sun&rsquo;s bright beam,<br />
The softness of the pale moon stream,<br />
The flow&rsquo;ret&rsquo;s grace, the river&rsquo;s voice,<br />
The tune to which the birds rejoice;<br />
Without it, vain each learned page,<br />
Cold and unfelt each council sage,<br />
Heavy and dull each human feature,<br />
Lifeless and wretched every creature;<br />
In which alone the glory lies,<br />
Which value gives to sacrifice?<br />
&rsquo;Tis that which formed the whole creation,<br />
Which rests on every generation.<br />
Of Paradise the only token<br />
Just left us, &rsquo;mid our treasures broken,<br />
Which never can from us be riven,<br />
Sure earnest of the joys of Heaven.<br />
And which, when earth shall pass away,<br />
Shall be our rest on the last day,<br />
When tongues shall fail and knowledge cease,<br />
And throbbing hearts be all at peace:<br />
When faith is sight, and hope is sure,<br />
That which alone shall still endure<br />
Of earthly joys in heaven above,<br />
&rsquo;Tis that best gift, eternal Love!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;What have you there?&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, who had
come towards them while Claude was reading the lines.&nbsp;
Taking the paper from Claude&rsquo;s hand, he read it to himself,
and then saying, &lsquo;Tolerable, Lily; there are some things to
alter, but you may easily make it passable,&rsquo; he went on to
his own place, leaving Lilias triumphant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Claude, you see I have the great Baron on my
side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am of the Baron&rsquo;s opinion,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;the only wonder is that you doubted it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seemed to say that love was good for
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I said nothing but that Lily has a rhyme.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And saying that I was silly, was equivalent to saying
that love was nothing,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Lily, I hope not,&rsquo; said Claude, with a comical
air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I know I often am foolish, but not in
this,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;I do say that mere duty is not
lovable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say it if you will then,&rsquo; said Claude, yawning,
&lsquo;only let me finish this sermon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily set herself to reconsider some of her lines: but
presently Emily left the room, Claude looked up, and Lily
exclaimed, &lsquo;Now, Claude, let us make a trial of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Claude, yawning again, and looking
resigned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think how Eleanor went on telling us of duty, duty,
duty&mdash;never making allowances&mdash;never relaxing her stiff
rules about trifles&mdash;never unbending from her duenna-like
dignity&mdash;never showing one spark of enthusiasm&mdash;making
great sacrifices, but only because she thought them her
duty&mdash;because it was right&mdash;good for herself&mdash;only
a higher kind of selfishness&mdash;not because her feeling
prompted her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, feeling does not usually prompt people to
give up their lovers for the sake of their brothers and
sisters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did it because it was her duty,&rsquo; said Lily,
&lsquo;quite as if she did not care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder whether Frank thought so,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At any rate you will confess that Emily is a much more
engaging person,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, I had rather talk nonsense to her,&rsquo;
said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You feel it, though you will not allow it,&rsquo; said
Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now think of Emily&rsquo;s sympathy, and
gentleness, and sweet smile, and tell me if she is not a complete
personification of love.&nbsp; And then Eleanor,
unpoetical&mdash;never thrown off her balance by grief or joy,
with no ups and downs&mdash;no enthusiasm&mdash;no appreciation
of the beautiful&mdash;her highest praise &ldquo;very
right,&rdquo; and tell me if there can be a better image of
duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude might have had some chance of bringing Lily to her
senses, if he had allowed that there was some truth in what she
had said; but he thought the accusation so unjust in general,
that he would not agree to any part of it, and only answered,
&lsquo;You have very strange views of duty and of
Eleanor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; replied Lily, &lsquo;I only ask you to
watch; Emily and I are determined to act on the principle of
love, and you will see if her government is not more successful
than that of duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such was the principle upon which Lily intended her sister to
govern the household, and to which Emily listened without knowing
what she meant much better than she did herself.&nbsp;
Emily&rsquo;s own views, as far as she possessed any, were to get
on as smoothly as she could, and make everybody pleased and
happy, without much trouble to herself, and also to make the
establishment look a little more as if a Lady Emily had lately
been its mistress, than had been the case in Eleanor&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; Mr. Mohun&rsquo;s property was good, but he wished to
avoid unnecessary display and expense, and he expected his
daughters to follow out these views, keeping a wise check upon
Emily, by looking over her accounts every Saturday, and turning a
deaf ear when she talked of the age of the drawing-room carpet,
and the ugliness of the old chariot.&nbsp; Emily had a good deal
on her hands, requiring sense and activity, but Lilias and Jane
were now quite old enough to assist her.&nbsp; Lily however,
thought fit to despise all household affairs, and bestowed the
chief of her attention on her own department&mdash;the village
school and poor people; and she was also much engrossed by her
music and drawing, her German and Italian, and her verse
writing.</p>
<p>Claude had more power over her than any one else.&nbsp; He was
a gentle, amiable boy, of high talent, but disposed to indolence
by ill health.&nbsp; In most matters he was, however, victorious
over this propensity, which was chiefly visible in his love of
easy chairs, and his dislike of active sports, which made him the
especial companion of his sisters.&nbsp; A dangerous illness had
occasioned his removal from Eton, and he had since been at home,
reading with his cousin Mr. Devereux, and sharing his
sisters&rsquo; amusements.</p>
<p>Jane was in her own estimation an important member of the
administration, and in fact, was Emily&rsquo;s chief assistant
and deputy.&nbsp; She was very small and trimly made, everything
fitted her precisely, and she had tiny dexterous fingers, and
active little feet, on which she darted about noiselessly and
swiftly as an arrow; an oval brown face, bright colour, straight
features, and smooth dark hair, bright sparkling black eyes, a
little mouth, wearing an arch subdued smile, very white teeth,
and altogether the air of a woman in miniature.&nbsp; Brisk,
bold, and blithe&mdash;ever busy and ever restless, she was
generally known by the names of Brownie and Changeling, which
were not inappropriate to her active and prying disposition.</p>
<p>Excepting Claude and Emily, the young party were early risers,
and Lily especially had generally despatched a good deal of
business before the eight o&rsquo;clock breakfast.</p>
<p>At nine they went to church, Mr. Devereux having restored the
custom of daily service, and after this, Mr. Mohun attended to
his multitudinous affairs; Claude went to the
parsonage,&mdash;Emily to the storeroom, Lily to the village, the
younger girls to the schoolroom, where they were presently joined
by Emily.&nbsp; Lily remained in her own room till one
o&rsquo;clock, when she joined the others in the schoolroom, and
they read aloud some book of history till two, the hour of dinner
for the younger, and of luncheon for the elder.&nbsp; They then
went out, and on their return from evening service, which began
at half-past four, the little ones had their lessons to learn,
and the others were variously employed till dinner, the time of
which was rather uncertain but always late.&nbsp; The evening
passed pleasantly and quickly away in reading, work, music, and
chatter.</p>
<p>As Emily had expected, her first troubles were with Phyllis;
called, not the neat handed, by her sisters; Master Phyl, by her
brothers; and Miss Tomboy, by the maids.&nbsp; She seemed born to
be a trial of patience to all concerned with her; yet without
many actual faults, except giddiness, restlessness, and
unrestrained spirits.&nbsp; In the drawing-room, schoolroom, and
nursery she was continually in scrapes, and so often reproved and
repentant, that her loud roaring fits of crying were amongst the
ordinary noises of the New Court.&nbsp; She was terribly awkward
when under constraint, or in learning any female accomplishment,
but swift and ready when at her ease, and glorying in the boyish
achievements of leaping ditches and climbing trees.&nbsp; Her
voice was rather highly pitched, and she had an inveterate habit
of saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; at the
beginning of all her speeches.&nbsp; She was not tall, but
strong, square, firm, and active; she had a round merry face, a
broad forehead, and large bright laughing eyes, of a doubtful
shade between gray and brown.&nbsp; Her mouth was wide, her nose
turned up, her complexion healthy, but not rosy, and her stiff
straight brown hair was more apt to hang over her eyes, than to
remain in its proper place behind her ears.</p>
<p>Adeline was very different; her fair and brilliant complexion,
her deep blue eyes and golden ringlets, made her a very lovely
little creature; her quietness was a relief after her
sister&rsquo;s boisterous merriment, and her dislike of dirt and
brambles, continually contrasted with poor Phyllis&rsquo;s
recklessness of such impediments.&nbsp; Ada readily learnt
lessons, which cost Phyllis and her teacher hours of toil; Ada
worked deftly when Phyllis&rsquo;s stiff fingers never willingly
touched a needle; Ada played with a doll, drew on scraps of
paper, or put up dissected maps, while Phyllis was in mischief or
in the way.&nbsp; A book was the only chance of interesting her;
but very few books took her fancy enough to occupy her
long;&mdash;those few, however, she read over and over again, and
when unusual tranquillity reigned in the drawing-room, she was
sure to be found curled up at the top of the library steps,
reading one of three books&mdash;<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>,
<i>Little Jack</i>, or <i>German Popular Tales</i>.&nbsp; Then
Emily blamed her ungraceful position, Jane laughed at her uniform
taste, and Lily proposed some story about modern children, such
as Phyllis never could like, and the constant speech was
repeated, &lsquo;Only look at Ada!&rsquo; till Phyllis considered
her sister as a perfect model, and sighed over her own
naughtiness.</p>
<p><i>German Popular Tales</i> were a recent introduction of
Claude&rsquo;s, for Eleanor had carefully excluded all fairy
tales from her sisters&rsquo; library; so great was her dread of
works of fiction, that Emily and Lilias had never been allowed to
read any of the Waverley Novels, excepting <i>Guy Mannering</i>,
which their brother Henry had insisted upon reading aloud to them
the last time he was at home, and that had taken so strong a hold
on their imagination, that Eleanor was quite alarmed.</p>
<p>One day Mr. Mohun chanced to refer to some passage in
<i>Waverley</i>, and on finding that his daughters did not
understand him, he expressed great surprise at their want of
taste.</p>
<p>Poor things,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;they cannot help it;
do not you know that Eleanor thinks the Waverley Novels a sort of
slow poison?&nbsp; They know no more of them than their
outsides.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the sooner they know the inside the
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then may we really read them, papa?&rsquo; cried
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And welcome,&rsquo; said her father.</p>
<p>This permission once given, the young ladies had no idea of
moderation; Lily&rsquo;s heart and soul were wrapped up in
whatever tale she chanced to be reading&mdash;she talked of
little else, she neglected her daily occupations, and was in a
kind of trance for about three weeks.&nbsp; At length she was
recalled to her senses by her father&rsquo;s asking her why she
had shown him no drawings lately.&nbsp; Lily hesitated for a
moment, and then said, &lsquo;Papa, I am sorry I was so
idle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;let us be able
to give a good account of ourselves when Eleanor
comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid, papa,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;the truth
is, that my head has been so full of <i>Woodstock</i> for the
last few days, that I could do nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And before that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And last week?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Waverley</i>.&nbsp; Oh! papa, I am afraid you must
be very angry with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Lily, not yet,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;I
do not think you quite knew what an intoxicating draught you had
got hold of; I should have cautioned you.&nbsp; Your negligence
has not yet been a serious fault, though remember, that it
becomes so after warning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;I will just finish
<i>Peveril</i> at once, and get it out of my head, and then read
no more of the dear books,&rsquo; and she gave a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lily would take the temperance pledge, on condition
that she might finish her bottle at a draught,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.</p>
<p>Lily laughed, and looked down, feeling quite unable to offer
to give up <i>Peveril</i> before she had finished it, but her
father relieved her, by saying in his kind voice, &lsquo;No, no,
Lily, take my advice, read those books, for most of them are very
good reading, and very pretty reading, and very useful reading,
and you can hardly be called a well-educated person if you do not
know them; but read them only after the duties of the day are
done&mdash;make them your pleasure, but do not make yourself
their slave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lily,&rsquo; said Claude the next morning, as he saw
her prepare her drawing-desk, &lsquo;why are you not reading
<i>Peveril</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know what papa said yesterday,&rsquo; was the
answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! but I thought your feelings were with poor Julian
in the Tower,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My feelings prompt me to sacrifice my pleasure in
reading about him to please papa, after he spoke so
kindly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that is always the effect of your principle, I shall
think better of it,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>Lily, whether from her new principle, or her old habits of
obedience, never ventured to touch one of her tempters till after
five o&rsquo;clock, but, as she was a very rapid reader, she
generally contrived to devour more than a sufficient quantity
every evening, so that she did not enjoy them as much as she
would, had she been less voracious in her appetite, and they made
her complain grievously of the dulness of the latter part of
Russell&rsquo;s <i>Modern Europe</i>, which was being read in the
schoolroom, and yawn nearly as much as Phyllis over the
&lsquo;Pragmatic Sanction.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, when that book
was concluded, and they began Palgrave&rsquo;s <i>Anglo
Saxons</i>, Lily was seized within a sudden historical
fever.&nbsp; She could hardly wait till one o&rsquo;clock, before
she settled herself at the schoolroom table with her work, and
summoned every one, however occupied, to listen to the
reading.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">HONEST PHYL</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Multiplication<br />
Is a vexation.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a bright and beautiful
afternoon in March, the song of the blackbird and thrush, and the
loud chirp of the titmouse, came merrily through the schoolroom
window, mixed with the sounds of happy voices in the garden; the
western sun shone brightly in, and tinged the white wainscoted
wall with yellow light; the cat sat in the window-seat, winking
at the sun, and sleepily whisking her tail for the amusement of
her kitten, which was darting to and fro, and patting her on the
head, in the hope of rousing her to some more active sport.</p>
<p>But in the midst of all these joyous sights and sounds, was
heard a dolorous voice repeating, &lsquo;three and four
are&mdash;three and four are&mdash;oh dear! they are&mdash;seven,
no, but I do not think it is a four after all, is it not a
one?&nbsp; Oh dear!&rsquo;&nbsp; And on the floor lay Phyllis,
her back to the window, kicking her feet slowly up and down, and
yawning and groaning over her slate.</p>
<p>Presently the door opened, and Claude looked in, and very
nearly departed again instantly, for Phyllis at that moment made
a horrible squeaking with her slate-pencil, the sound above all
others that he disliked.&nbsp; He, however, stopped, and asked
where Emily was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out in the garden,&rsquo; answered Phyllis, with a
tremendous yawn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing here, looking so piteous?&rsquo;
said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sum,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this your time of day for arithmetic?&rsquo; asked
he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Phyllis, &lsquo;only I had not done it
by one o&rsquo;clock to-day, and Lily said I must finish after
learning my lessons for to-morrow, but I do not think I shall
ever have done, it is so hard.&nbsp; Oh!&rsquo; (another stretch
and a yawn, verging on a howl), &lsquo;and Jane and Ada are
sowing the flower-seeds.&nbsp; Oh dear!&nbsp; Oh dear!&rsquo; and
Phyllis&rsquo;s face contracted, in readiness to cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is that the best position for doing sums?&rsquo;
said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was obliged to lie down here to get out of the way of
Ada&rsquo;s sum,&rsquo; said Phyllis, getting up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get out of the way of Ada&rsquo;s sum?&rsquo; repeated
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she left it on the table where I was sitting,
where I could see it, and it is this very one, so I must not look
at it; I wish I could do sums as fast as she can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could you not have turned the other side of the slate
upwards?&rsquo; said Claude, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I could!&rsquo; said Phyllis, as if a new light had
broken in upon her.&nbsp; &lsquo;But then I wanted to be out of
sight of pussy, for I could not think a bit, while the kitten was
at play so prettily, and I kicked my heels to keep from hearing
the voices in the garden, for it does make me so
unhappy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some good-natured brothers would have told the little girl not
to mind, and sent her out to enjoy herself, but Claude respected
Phyllis&rsquo;s honesty too much to do so, and he said,
&lsquo;Well, Phyl, let me see the sum, and we will try if we
cannot conquer it between us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis&rsquo;s face cleared up in an instant, as she brought
the slate to her brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I do not
understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Compound Addition,&rsquo; said Phyllis, &lsquo;I did
one with Emily yesterday, and this is the second.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! these are marks between the pounds, shillings, and
pence,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;I took them for elevens; well,
I do not wonder at your troubles, I could not do this sum as it
is set.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could not you, indeed?&rsquo; cried Phyllis, quite
delighted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose we
set it again, more clearly; but how is this?&nbsp; When I was in
the schoolroom we always had a sponge fastened to the
slate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Phyllis, &lsquo;I had one before
Eleanor went, but my string broke, and I lost it, and Emily
always forgets to give me another.&nbsp; I will run and wash the
slate in the nursery; but how shall we know what the sum
is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I suppose I may look at Ada&rsquo;s slate, though
you must not,&rsquo; said Claude, laughing to himself at poor
little honest simplicity, as he applied himself to cut a new
point to her very stumpy slate-pencil, and she scampered away,
and returned in a moment with her clean slate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, how nice and fresh it all looks!&rsquo; said she as
he set down the clear large figures.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot think
how you can do it so evenly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Phyl, do not let the pencil scream if you can help
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude found that Phyllis&rsquo;s great difficulty was with
the farthings.&nbsp; She could not understand the fractional
figures, and only knew thus far, that &lsquo;Emily said it never
meant four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude began explaining, but his first attempt was far too
scientific.&nbsp; Phyllis gave a desponding sigh, looking so
mystified, that he began to believe that she was hopelessly dull,
and to repent of having offered to help her; but at last, by
means of dividing a card into four pieces, he succeeded in making
her comprehend him, and her eyes grew bright with the pleasure of
understanding.</p>
<p>Even then the difficulties were not conquered, her addition
was very slow, and dividing by twelve and twenty seemed endless
work; at length the last figure of the pounds was set down, the
slate was compared with Adeline&rsquo;s, and the sum pronounced
to be right.&nbsp; Phyllis capered up to the kitten and tossed it
up in the air in her joy, then coming slowly back to her brother,
she said with a strange, awkward air, hanging down her head,
&lsquo;Claude, I&rsquo;ll tell you what&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what?&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to kiss you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then away she bounded, clattered down stairs, and flew across
the lawn to tell every one she met that Claude had helped her to
do her sum, and that it was quite right.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you expect that it would be too hard for him,
Phyl?&rsquo; said Jane, laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Phyllis, &lsquo;but he said he could
not do it as it was set.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And whose fault was that?&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! but he showed me how to set it better,&rsquo; said
Phyllis, &lsquo;and he said that when he learnt the beginning of
fractions, he thought them as hard as I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fractions!&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;you do not fancy
you have come to fractions yet!&nbsp; Fine work you will make of
them when you do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the evening, as soon as the children were gone to bed, Jane
took a paper out of her work-basket, saying, &lsquo;There, Emily,
is my account of Phyl&rsquo;s scrapes through this whole week; I
told you I should write them all down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How kind!&rsquo; muttered Claude.</p>
<p>Regardless of her brother, who had not looked up from his
book, Jane began reading her list of poor Phyllis&rsquo;s
misadventures.&nbsp; &lsquo;On Monday she tore her frock by
climbing a laurel-tree, to look at a blackbird&rsquo;s
nest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I gave her leave,&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Rachel had ordered her not to climb; and she was crying
because she could not see the nest that Wat Greenwood had
found.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On Tuesday she cried over her French grammar, and tore
a leaf out of the old spelling-book.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was nearly out before,&rsquo; said Emily,
&lsquo;Maurice and Redgie spoilt that long ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know of anything on Wednesday, but on Thursday
she threw Ada down the steps out of the nursery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that accounts for the dreadful screaming that I
heard,&rsquo; said Claude; &lsquo;I forgot to ask the meaning of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure it was Phyl that was the most dismayed, and
cried the loudest,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That she always does,&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;On
Friday we had an uproar in the schoolroom about her hemming, and
on Saturday she tumbled into a wet ditch, and tore her bonnet in
the brambles; on Sunday, she twisted her ancles together at
church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there I did chance to observe her,&rsquo; said
Lily, &lsquo;there seemed to be a constant struggle between her
ancles and herself, they were continually coming lovingly
together, but were separated the next moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to-day this sum,&rsquo; said Jane; &lsquo;seven
scrapes in one week!&nbsp; I really am of opinion, as Rachel says
when she is angry, that school is the best place for
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think so too,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;she is very
troublesome, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Claude!&rsquo; cried Lily, &lsquo;you do not mean
that you would have that poor dear merry Master Phyl sent to
school, she would pine away like a wild bird in a cage; but papa
will never think of such a thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I thought of her being sent to school,&rsquo; said
Claude, &lsquo;it would be to shield her from&mdash;the rule of
love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! you think we are too indulgent,&rsquo; said Emily;
&lsquo;perhaps we are, but you know we cannot torment a poor
child all day long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you call the way you treat her indulgent, I should
like to know what you call severe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, Claude?&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I call your indulgence something like the tender
mercies of the wicked,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;On a fine
day, when every one is taking their pleasure in the garden, to
shut an unhappy child up in the schoolroom, with a hard sum that
you have not taken the trouble to teach her how to do, and late
in the day, when no one&rsquo;s head is clear for difficult
arithmetic&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hard sum do you call it?&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed I explained it to her,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And well she understood you,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She might have learnt if she had attended,&rsquo; said
Emily; &lsquo;Ada understood clearly, with the same
explanation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do not you be too proud of the effect of your
instructions, Claude,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;for when honest
Phyl came into the garden, she did not know farthings from
fractions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pray, Mrs. Senior Wrangler,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;will you tell me where is the difference between a
half-penny and half a penny?&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a good laugh at Jane&rsquo;s expense, Emily went on,
&lsquo;Now, Claude, I will tell you how it happened; Phyllis is
so slow, and dawdles over her lessons so long, that it is quite a
labour to hear her; Ada is quick enough, but if you were to hear
Phyllis say one column of spelling, you would know what misery
is.&nbsp; Then before she has half finished, the clock strikes
one, it is time to read, and the lessons are put off till the
afternoon.&nbsp; I certainly did not know that she was about her
sum all that time, or I would have sent her out as I did on
Saturday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the reading at one is as fixed as fate,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;when we were about old
&ldquo;Russell,&rdquo; we did not begin till nearly two, but
since we have been reading this book, Lily will never let us rest
till we begin; she walks up and down, and hurries and worries
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Emily, in a murmuring voice, &lsquo;we
should do better if Lily would not make such a point of that one
thing; but she never minds what else is cut short, and she never
thinks of helping me.&nbsp; It never seems to enter her head how
much I have on my hands, and no one does anything to help
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Emily! you never asked me,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew you would not like it,&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, it is not my way to complain, people may see how to
help me if they choose to do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lily, Lily, take care,&rsquo; said Claude, in a low
voice; &lsquo;is not the rule you admire, the rule of love of
yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Claude!&rsquo; returned Lily, &lsquo;do not say so,
you know it was Emily that I called an example of it, not myself,
and see how forbearing she has been.&nbsp; Now I see that I am
really wanted, I will help.&nbsp; It must be love, not duty, that
calls me to the schoolroom, for no one ever said that was my
province.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor duty! you give it a very narrow
boundary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias, who, to say the truth, had been made more careful of
her own conduct, by the wish to establish her principle, really
betook herself to the schoolroom for an hour every morning, with
a desire to be useful.&nbsp; She thought she did great things in
undertaking those tasks of Phyllis&rsquo;s which Emily most
disliked.&nbsp; But Lilias was neither patient nor humble enough
to be a good teacher, though she could explain difficult rules in
a sensible way.&nbsp; She could not, or would not, understand the
difference between dulness and inattention; her sharp hasty
manner would frighten away all her pupil&rsquo;s powers of
comprehension; she sometimes fell into the great error of
scolding, when Phyllis was doing her best, and the poor
child&rsquo;s tears flowed more frequently than ever.</p>
<p>Emily&rsquo;s gentle manner made her instructions far more
agreeable, though she was often neither clear nor correct in her
explanations; she was contented if the lessons were droned
through in any manner, so long as she could say they were done;
she disliked a disturbance, and overlooked or half corrected
mistakes rather than cause a cry.&nbsp; Phyllis naturally
preferred being taught by her, and Lily was vexed and unwilling
to persevere.&nbsp; She went to the schoolroom expecting to be
annoyed, created vexation for herself, and taught in anything but
a loving spirit.&nbsp; Still, however, the thought of Claude, and
the wish to do more than her duty, kept her constant to her
promise, and her love of seeing things well done was useful,
though sadly counterbalanced by her deficiency in temper and
patience.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The deeds we do, the words we say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into still air they seem to fleet;<br />
We count them past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they shall last.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after Easter, Claude went to
Oxford.&nbsp; He was much missed by his sisters, who wanted him
to carve for them at luncheon, to escort them when they rode or
walked, to hear their music, talk over their books, advise
respecting their drawings, and criticise Lily&rsquo;s
verses.&nbsp; A new subject of interest was, however, arising for
them in the neighbours who were shortly expected to arrive at
Broom Hill, a house which had lately been built in a hamlet about
a mile and a half from the New Court.</p>
<p>These new comers were the family of a barrister of the name of
Weston, who had taken the house for the sake of his wife, her
health having been much injured by her grief at the loss of two
daughters in the scarlet fever.&nbsp; Two still remained, a
grown-up young lady, and a girl of eleven years old, and the Miss
Mohuns learnt with great delight that they should have near
neighbours of their own age.&nbsp; They had never had any young
companions as young ladies were scarce among their acquaintance,
and they had not seen their cousin, Lady Florence Devereux, since
they were children.</p>
<p>It was with great satisfaction that Emily and Lilias set out
with their father to make the first visit, and they augured well
from their first sight of Mrs. Weston and her daughters.&nbsp;
Mrs. Weston was alone, her daughters being out walking, and Lily
spent the greater part of the visit in silence, though her mind
was made up in the first ten minutes, as she told Emily on
leaving the house, &lsquo;that Miss Weston&rsquo;s tastes were in
complete accordance with her own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rapid judgment,&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Love
before first sight.&nbsp; But Mrs. Weston is a very sweet
person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, Emily, did you see the music-book open at
&ldquo;Angels ever bright and fair?&rdquo;&nbsp; If Miss Weston
sings that as I imagine it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you see what was in the music-book at the
other end of the room?&nbsp; I only saw it was a beautiful
piano.&nbsp; And what handsome furniture! it made me doubly
ashamed of our faded carpet and chairs, almost as old as the
house itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily!&rsquo; said Lily, in her most earnest tones,
&lsquo;I would not change one of those dear old chairs for a
king&rsquo;s ransom!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The visit was in a short time returned, and though it was but
a formal morning call, Lilias found her bright expectations
realised by the sweetness of Alethea Weston&rsquo;s manners, and
the next time they met it was a determined thing in her mind
that, as Claude would have said, they had sworn an eternal
friendship.</p>
<p>She had the pleasure of lionising the two sisters over the Old
Court, telling all she knew and all she imagined about the siege,
Sir Maurice Mohun, and his faithful servant, Walter
Greenwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss Weston,&rsquo; said she in
conclusion, &lsquo;have you read <i>Old Mortality</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Alethea, amused at the question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they say I am as bad as Lady Margaret about the
king&rsquo;s visit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not heard the story often enough to think
so,&rsquo; said Miss Weston, &lsquo;I will warn you if I
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Phyllis and Adeline were equally charmed with
Marianne, though shocked at her ignorance of country manners,
and, indeed, Alethea was quite diverted with Lily&rsquo;s pity at
the discovery that she had never before been in the country in
the spring.&nbsp; &lsquo;What,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;have you
never seen the tufts of red on the hazel, nor the fragrant golden
palms, and never heard the blackbird rush twittering out of the
hedge, nor the first nightingale&rsquo;s note, nor the
nightjar&rsquo;s low chirr, nor the chattering of the
rooks?&nbsp; O what a store of sweet memories you have
lost!&nbsp; Why, how can you understand the beginning of the
Allegro?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Both the Miss Westons had so much pleasure in making
acquaintance with &lsquo;these delights,&rsquo; as quite to
compensate for their former ignorance, and soon the New Court
rang with their praises.&nbsp; Mr. Mohun thought very highly of
the whole family, and rejoiced in such society for his daughters,
and they speedily became so well acquainted, that it was the
ordinary custom of the Westons to take luncheon at the New Court
on Sunday.&nbsp; On her side, however, Alethea Weston felt some
reluctance to become intimate with the young ladies of the New
Court.&nbsp; She was pleased with Emily&rsquo;s manners,
interested by Lily&rsquo;s earnestness and simplicity, and
thought Jane a clever and amusing little creature, but even their
engaging qualities gave her pain, by reminding her of the sisters
she had lost, or by making her think how they would have liked
them.&nbsp; A country house and neighbours like these had been
the objects of many visions of their childhood, and now all the
sweet sights and sounds around her only made her think how she
should have enjoyed them a year ago.&nbsp; She felt almost
jealous of Marianne&rsquo;s liking for her new friends, lest they
should steal her heart from Emma and Lucy; but knowing that these
were morbid and unthankful feelings, she struggled against them,
and though she missed her sisters even more than when her mother
and Marianne were in greater need of her attention, she let no
sign of her sorrowful feeling appear, and seeing that Marianne
was benefited in health and spirits, by intercourse with young
companions, she gave no hint of her disinclination to join in the
walks and other amusements of the Miss Mohuns.</p>
<p>She also began to take interest in the poor people.&nbsp; By
Mrs. Weston&rsquo;s request, Mr. Devereux had pointed out the
families which were most in need of assistance, and Alethea made
it her business to find out the best way of helping them.&nbsp;
She visited the village school with Lilias, and when requested by
her and by the Rector to give her aid in teaching, she did not
like to refuse what might be a duty, though she felt very
diffident of her powers of instruction.&nbsp; Marianne, like
Phyllis and Adeline, became a Sunday scholar, and was catechised
with the others in church.&nbsp; Both Mr. Mohun and his nephew
thought very highly of the family, and the latter was
particularly glad that Lily should have some older person to
assist her in those parish matters which he left partly in her
charge.</p>
<p>Mr. Devereux had been Rector of Beechcroft about a year and a
half, and had hitherto been much liked.&nbsp; His parishioners
had known him from a boy, and were interested about him, and
though very young, there was something about him that gained
their respect.&nbsp; Almost all his plans were going on well, and
things were, on the whole, in a satisfactory state, though no one
but Lilias expected even Cousin Robert to make a Dreamland of
Beechcroft, and there were days when he looked worn and anxious,
and the girls suspected that some one was behaving ill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you a headache, Robert?&rsquo; asked Emily, a few
evenings before Whit-Sunday, &lsquo;you have not spoken three
words this evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all, thank you,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux,
smiling, &lsquo;you need not think to make me your victim, now
you have no Claude to nurse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then if it is not bodily, it is mental,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am in a difficulty about the christening of Mrs.
Naylor&rsquo;s child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naylor the blacksmith?&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
thought it was high time for it to be christened.&nbsp; It must
be six weeks old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it not to be on Whit-Sunday?&rsquo; said Lily,
disconsolately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no!&nbsp; Mrs. Naylor will not hear of bringing the
child on a Sunday, and I could hardly make her think it possible
to bring it on Whit-Tuesday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you not insist?&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I might, if there was no other holy day at
hand, or if there was not another difficulty, a point on which I
cannot give way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! the godfathers and godmothers,&rsquo; said Lily,
&lsquo;does she want that charming brother of hers, Edward
Gage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and what is worse, Edward Gage&rsquo;s dissenting
wife, and Dick Rodd, who shows less sense of religion than any
one in the parish, and has never been confirmed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could you make them hear reason?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were inclined to be rather impertinent,&rsquo;
said Mr. Devereux.&nbsp; &lsquo;Old Mrs. Gage&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; interrupted Jane, &lsquo;there is no hope
for you if the sour Gage is in the pie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sour Gage told me people were not so particular in
her younger days, and perhaps they should not have the child
christened at all, since I was such a <i>contrary</i>
gentleman.&nbsp; Tom Naylor was not at home, I am to see him
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I do not think Tom Naylor is as bad as the
rest,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;he would have been tolerable, if
he had married any one but Martha Gage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he is an open good-natured fellow, and I have
hopes of making an impression on him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If not,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;I hope papa will take
away his custom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, who always heard any
mention of himself.&nbsp; Mr. Devereux repeated his history, and
discussed the matter with his uncle, only once interrupted by an
inquiry from Jane about the child&rsquo;s name, a point on which
she could gain no intelligence.&nbsp; His report the next day was
not decidedly unfavourable, though he scarcely hoped the
christening would be so soon as Tuesday.&nbsp; He had not seen
the father, and suspected he had purposely kept out of the
way.</p>
<p>Jane, disappointed that the baby&rsquo;s name remained a
mystery, resolved to set out on a voyage of discovery.&nbsp;
Accordingly, as soon as her cousin was gone, she asked Emily if
she had not been saying that Ada wanted some more cotton for her
sampler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;but I am not going to
walk all the way to Mrs. Appleton&rsquo;s this
afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I go?&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ada, run and
fetch your pattern.&rsquo;&nbsp; Emily and Ada were much obliged
by Jane&rsquo;s disinterested offer, and in a quarter of an hour
Ada&rsquo;s thoughts and hands were busy in Mrs. Appleton&rsquo;s
drawer of many-coloured cotton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a pity this is about Mrs. Naylor&rsquo;s
baby,&rsquo; began Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a sad story indeed, Miss Jane, I am sure it must
be grievous to Mr. Devereux,&rsquo; said Mrs. Appleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Betsy Wall said he had been there three times about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! we all know that Walls have ears,&rsquo; said Jane;
&lsquo;how that Betsy does run about gossiping!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss Jane, there she bides all day long at the
stile gaping; not a stitch does she do for her mother; I cannot
tell what is to be the end of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do you know what the child&rsquo;s name is to be,
Mrs. Appleton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Miss Jane,&rsquo; answered Mrs. Appleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Betsy did say they talked of naming him after his uncle,
Edward Gage, only Mr. Devereux would not let him
stand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;Since he married
that dissenting wife he never comes near the church; he is too
much like the sour Gage, as we call his mother, to be good for
much.&nbsp; But, after all, he is not so bad as Dick Rodd, who
has never been confirmed, and has never shown any sense of
religion in his life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss, Dick Rodd is a sad fellow: did you hear what
a row there was at the Mohun Arms last week, Miss
Jane?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;and papa says he shall
certainly turn Dick Rodd out of the house as soon as the lease is
out, and it is only till next Michaelmas
twelve-months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss, as I said to Betsy Wall, it would be more
for their interest to behave well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed it would,&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;Robert
and papa were talking of having their horses shod at Stoney
Bridge, if Tom Naylor will be so obstinate, only papa does not
like to give Tom up if he can help it, because his father was so
good, and Tom would not be half so bad if he had not married one
of the Gages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is Cousin Robert coming down the lane,&rsquo; said
Ada, who had chosen her cotton, and was gazing from the
door.&nbsp; Jane gave a violent start, took a hurried leave of
Mrs. Appleton, and set out towards home; she could not avoid
meeting her cousin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Jenny! have you been enjoying a gossip with your
great ally?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have only been buying pink cotton,&rsquo; said Ada,
whose conscience was clear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux, &lsquo;Beechcroft affairs
would soon stand still, without those useful people, Mrs.
Appleton, Miss Wall, and Miss Jane Mohun,&rsquo; and he passed
on.&nbsp; Jane felt her face colouring, his freedom from
suspicion made her feel very guilty, but the matter soon passed
out of her mind.</p>
<p>Blithe Whit-Sunday came, the five Miss Mohuns appeared in
white frocks, new bonnets were plenty, the white tippets of the
children, and the bright shawls of the mothers, made the village
look gay; Wat Greenwood stuck a pink between his lips, and the
green boughs of hazel and birch decked the dark oak carvings in
the church.</p>
<p>And Whit-Monday came.&nbsp; At half-past ten the rude music of
the band of the Friendly Society came pealing from the top of the
hill, then appeared two tall flags, crowned with guelder roses
and peonies, then the great blue drum, the clarionet blown by
red-waist-coated and red-faced Mr. Appleton, the three flutes and
the triangle, all at their loudest, causing some of the
spectators to start, and others to dance.&nbsp; Then behold the
whole procession of labourers, in white round frocks, blue
ribbons in their hats, and tall blue staves in their hands.&nbsp;
In the rear, the confused mob, women and children, cheerful faces
and mirthful sounds everywhere.&nbsp; These were hushed as the
flags were lowered to pass under the low-roofed gateway of the
churchyard, and all was still, except the trampling of feet on
the stone floor.&nbsp; Then the service began, the responses were
made in full and hearty tones, almost running into a chant, the
old 133rd Psalm was sung as loudly and as badly as usual, a very
short but very earnest sermon was preached, and forth came the
troop again.</p>
<p>Mr. Devereux always dined with the club in a tent, at the top
of the hill, but his uncle made him promise to come to a second
dinner at the New Court in the evening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert looks anxious,&rsquo; said Lily, as she parted
with him after the evening service; &lsquo;I am afraid something
is going wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trust me for finding out what it is,&rsquo; said
Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Jenny, do not ask him,&rsquo; said Lily;
&lsquo;if he tells us to relieve his mind, I am very glad he
should make friends of us, but do not ask.&nbsp; Let us talk of
other things to put it out of his head, whatever it may
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane soon heard more of the cause of the depression of her
cousin&rsquo;s spirits than even she had any desire to do.&nbsp;
After dinner, the girls were walking in the garden, enjoying the
warmth of the evening, when Mr. Devereux came up to her and drew
her aside from the rest, telling her that he wished to speak to
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;when am I to meet you at
school again?&nbsp; You never told me which chapter I was to
prepare; I cannot think what would become of your examinations if
it was not for me, you could not get an answer to one question in
three.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was not what I wished to speak to you
about,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux.&nbsp; &lsquo;What had you been
saying to Mrs. Appleton when I met you at her door on
Saturday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The colour rushed into Jane&rsquo;s cheeks, but she replied
without hesitation, &lsquo;Oh! different things, <i>La pluie et
le beau temps</i>, just as usual.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cannot you remember anything more
distinctly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always make a point of forgetting what I talk
about,&rsquo; said Jane, trying to laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Jane, let me tell you what has happened in the
village&mdash;as I came down the hill from the
club-dinner&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Jane, hoping to make a diversion,
&lsquo;Wat Greenwood came back about a quarter of an hour ago,
and he&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Devereux proceeded without attending to her, &lsquo;As I
came down the hill from the club-dinner, old Mrs. Gage came out
of Naylor&rsquo;s house, and her daughter with her, in great
anger, calling me to account for having spoken of her in a most
unbecoming way, calling her the sour Gage, and trying to set the
Squire against them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that abominable chattering woman!&rsquo; Jane
exclaimed; &lsquo;and Betsy Wall too, I saw her all alive about
something.&nbsp; What a nuisance such people are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In short,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux, &lsquo;I heard an
exaggerated account of all that passed here on the subject the
other day.&nbsp; Now, Jane, am I doing you any injustice in
thinking that it must have been through you that this history
went abroad into the village?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;I am sure you never told
us that it was any secret.&nbsp; When a story is openly told to
half a dozen people they cannot be expected to keep it to
themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I spoke uncharitably and incautiously,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;I am willing to confess, but it is nevertheless my duty to
set before you the great matter that this little fire has
kindled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it cannot have done any great harm, can it?&rsquo;
asked Jane, the agitation of her voice and laugh betraying that
she was not quite so careless as she wished to appear.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Only the sour Gage will ferment a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Jane!&nbsp; I did not expect that you would treat
this matter so lightly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But tell me, what harm has it done?&rsquo; asked
she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you consider it nothing that the poor child should
remain unbaptized, that discord should be brought into the
parish, that anger should be on the conscience of your neighbour,
that he should be driven from the church?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it as bad as that?&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We do not yet see the full extent of the mischief our
idle words may have done,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is their own fault, if they will do
wrong,&rsquo; said Jane; &lsquo;they ought not to be in a rage,
we said nothing but the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I was clear of the sin,&rsquo; said her
cousin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And after all,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;I cannot see
that I was much to blame; I only talked to Mrs. Appleton, as I
have done scores of times, and no one minded it.&nbsp; You only
laughed at me on Saturday, and papa and Eleanor never scolded
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot say that no one has ever tried to check
you,&rsquo; said the Rector.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how was I to know that that mischief-maker would
repeat it?&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not mean to say,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux,
&lsquo;that you actually committed a greater sin than you may
often have done, by talking in a way which you knew would
displease your father.&nbsp; I know we are too apt to treat
lightly the beginnings of evil, until some sudden sting makes us
feel what a serpent we have been fostering.&nbsp; Think this a
warning, pray that the evil we dread may be averted; but should
it ensue, consider it as a punishment sent in mercy.&nbsp; It
will be better for you not to come to school to-morrow; instead
of the references you were to have looked out, I had rather you
read over in a humble spirit the Epistle of St. James.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s tears by this time were flowing fast, and finding
that she no longer attempted to defend herself, her cousin said
no more.&nbsp; He joined the others, and Jane, escaping to her
own room, gave way to a passionate fit of crying.&nbsp; Whether
her tears were of true sorrow or of anger she could not have told
herself; she was still sobbing on her bed when the darkness came
on, and her two little sisters came in on their way to bed to
wish her good-night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Jane, Jane! what is the matter? have you been
naughty?&rsquo; asked the little girls in great amazement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Jane, shortly;
&lsquo;good-night,&rsquo; and she sat up and wiped away her
tears.&nbsp; The children still lingered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go away,
do,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is Robert gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Phyllis, &lsquo;he is reading the
newspaper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis and Adeline left the room, and Jane walked up and
down, considering whether she should venture to go down to tea;
perhaps her cousin had waited till the little girls had gone
before he spoke to Mr. Mohun, or perhaps her red eyes might cause
questions on her troubles; she was still in doubt when Lily
opened the door, a lamp in her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Jenny, are you here?&nbsp; Ada told me you were
crying, what is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you have not heard?&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only Robert began just now, &ldquo;Poor Jenny, she has
been the cause of getting us into a very awkward scrape,&rdquo;
but then Ada came to tell me about you, and I came
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Jane, angrily, &lsquo;he will throw
all the blame upon me, when I am sure it was quite as much the
fault of that horrible Mrs. Appleton, and papa will be as angry
as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what has happened?&rsquo; asked Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that chatterer, that worst of gossipers, has gone
and told the Naylors and Mrs. Gage all we said about them the
other day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you told Mrs. Appleton?&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;so
that was the reason you were so obliging about the marking
thread.&nbsp; Oh, Jane, you had better say no more about Mrs.
Appleton!&nbsp; And has it done much mischief?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Mrs. Gage &ldquo;pitched&rdquo; into Robert,
as Wat Greenwood would say, and the christening is off
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane, this is frightful,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;I do
not wonder that you are unhappy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I daresay it will all come right again,&rsquo;
said Jane; &lsquo;there will only be a little delay, papa and
Robert will bring them to their senses in time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose the baby was to die,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it will not die,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;a great
fat healthy thing like that likely to die indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot make you out, Jane,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If I had done such a thing, I do not think I could have a
happy minute till it was set right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I told you I was very sorry,&rsquo; said Jane,
&lsquo;only I wish they would not all be so hard upon me.&nbsp;
Robert owns that he should not have said such things if he did
not wish them to be repeated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does he?&rsquo; cried Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;How exactly
like Robert that is, to own himself in fault when he is obliged
to blame others.&nbsp; Jane, how could you hear him say such
things and not be overcome with shame?&nbsp; And then to turn it
against him!&nbsp; Oh, Jane, I do not think I can talk to you any
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not mean to say it was not very good of
him,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good of him&mdash;what a word!&rsquo; cried Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, good-night, I cannot bear to talk to you now.&nbsp;
Shall I say anything for you downstairs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, tell papa and Robert I am very sorry,&rsquo; said
Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall not come down again, you may leave the
lamp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On her way downstairs in the dark Lilias was led, by the
example of her cousin, to reflect that she was not without some
share in the mischief that had been done; the words which report
imputed to Mr. Devereux were mostly her own or
Jane&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There was no want of candour in Lily, and as
soon as she entered the drawing-room she went straight up to her
father and cousin, and began, &lsquo;Poor Jenny is very unhappy;
she desired me to tell you how sorry she is.&nbsp; But I really
believe that I did the mischief, Robert.&nbsp; It was I who said
those foolish things that were repeated as if you had said
them.&nbsp; It is a grievous affair, but who could have thought
that we were doing so much harm?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it may not do any,&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Naylors have a great deal of good about
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must have more than I suppose, if they can endure
what Robert is reported to have said of them,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you say, Robert,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;did
you not tell them all was said by your foolish young
cousins?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I agreed with you too much to venture on contradicting
the report; you know I could not even deny having called Mrs.
Gage by that name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if I could do anything to mend it!&rsquo; cried
Lily.</p>
<p>But wishes had no effect.&nbsp; Lilias and Jane had to mourn
over the full extent of harm done by hasty words.&nbsp; After the
more respectable men had left the Mohun Arms on the evening of
Whit-Monday, the rest gave way to unrestrained drunkenness, not
so much out of reckless self-indulgence, as to defy the clergyman
and the squire.&nbsp; They came to the front of the parsonage,
yelled and groaned for some time, and ended by breaking down the
gate.</p>
<p>This conduct was repeated on Tuesday, and on many Saturdays
following; some young trees in the churchyard were cut, and abuse
of the parson written on the walls the idle young men taking this
opportunity to revenge their own quarrels, caused by Mr.
Devereux&rsquo;s former efforts for their reformation.</p>
<p>On Sunday several children were absent from school; all those
belonging to Farmer Gage&rsquo;s labourers were taken away, and
one man was turned off by the farmers for refusing to remove his
child.</p>
<p>Now that the war was carried on so openly, Mr. Mohun
considered it his duty to withdraw his custom from one who chose
to set his pastor at defiance.&nbsp; He went to the forge, and
had a long conversation with the blacksmith, but though he was
listened to with respect, it was not easy to make much impression
on an ignorant, hot-tempered man, who had been greatly offended,
and prided himself on showing that he would support the quarrel
of his wife and her relations against both squire and parson; and
though Mr. Mohun did persuade him to own that it was wrong to be
at war with the clergyman, the effect of his arguments was soon
done away with by the Gages, and no ground was gained.</p>
<p>Mr. Gage&rsquo;s farm was unhappily at no great distance from
a dissenting chapel and school, in the adjoining parish of Stoney
Bridge, and thither the farmer and blacksmith betook themselves,
with many of the cottagers of Broom Hill.</p>
<p>One alone of the family of Tom Naylor refused to join him in
his dissent, and that was his sister, Mrs. Eden, a widow, with
one little girl about seven years old, who, though in great
measure dependent upon him for subsistence, knew her duty too
well to desert the church, or to take her child from school, and
continued her even course, toiling hard for bread, and
uncomplaining, though often munch distressed.&nbsp; All the rest
of the parish who were not immediately under Mr. Mohun&rsquo;s
influence were in a sad state of confusion.</p>
<p>Jane was grieved at heart, but would not confess it, and
Lilias was so restless and unhappy, that Emily was quite weary of
her lamentations.&nbsp; Her best comforter was Miss Weston, who
patiently listened to her, sighed with her over the evident
sorrow of the Rector, and the mischief in the parish, and proved
herself a true friend, by never attempting to extenuate her
fault.</p>
<h2><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE NEW FRIEND</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Maidens should be mild and meek,<br />
Swift to hear, and slow to speak.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Weston</span> had been much
interested by what she heard respecting Mrs. Eden, and gladly
discovered that she was just the person who could assist in some
needlework which was required at Broom Hill.&nbsp; She asked
Lilias to tell her where to find her cottage, and Lily replied by
an offer to show her the way; Miss Weston hesitated, thinking
that perhaps in the present state of things Lily had rather not
see her; but her doubts were quickly removed by this speech,
&lsquo;I want to see her particularly.&nbsp; I have been there
three times without finding her.&nbsp; I think I can set this
terrible matter right by speaking to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, Lilias and Phyllis set out with Alethea and
Marianne one afternoon to Mrs. Eden&rsquo;s cottage, which stood
at the edge of a long field at the top of the hill.&nbsp; Very
fast did Lily talk all the way, but she grew more silent as she
came to the cottage, and knocked at the door; it was opened by
Mrs. Eden herself, a pale, but rather pretty young woman, with a
remarkable gentle and pleasing face, and a manner which was
almost ladylike, although her hands were freshly taken out of the
wash-tub.&nbsp; She curtsied low, and coloured at the sight of
Lilias, set chairs for the visitors, and then returned to her
work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Mrs. Eden,&rsquo; Lily began, intending to make her
explanation, but feeling confused, thought it better to wait till
her friend&rsquo;s business was settled, and altered her speech
into &lsquo;Miss Weston is come to speak to you about some
work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Eden looked quite relieved, and Alethea proceeded to
appoint the day for her coming to Broom Hill, and arrange some
small matters, during which Lily not only settled what to say,
but worked herself into a fit of impatience at the length of
Alethea&rsquo;s instructions.&nbsp; When they were concluded,
however, and there was a pause, her words failed her, and she
wished that she was miles from the cottage, or that she had never
mentioned her intentions.&nbsp; At last she stammered out,
&lsquo;Oh! Mrs. Eden&mdash;I wanted to speak to you
about&mdash;about Mr. Devereux and your brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Eden bent over her wash-tub, Miss Weston examined the
shells on the chimney-piece, Marianne and Phyllis listened with
all their ears, and poor Lily was exceedingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wished to tell you&mdash;I do not think&mdash;I do
not mean&mdash;It was not his saying.&nbsp; Indeed, he did not
say those things about the Gages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told my brother I did not think Mr. Devereux would go
for to say such a thing,&rsquo; said Mrs. Eden, as much confused
as Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that was right, Mrs. Eden.&nbsp; The mischief was
all my making and Jane&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We said those foolish
things, and they were repeated as if it was he.&nbsp; Oh! do tell
your brother so, Mrs. Eden.&nbsp; It was very good of you to
think it was not Cousin Robert.&nbsp; Pray tell Tom Naylor.&nbsp;
I cannot bear that things should go on in this dreadful
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Miss, I am very sorry,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Eden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Mrs Eden, I am sure that would set it right
again,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;are not you?&nbsp; I would do
anything to have that poor baby christened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily&rsquo;s confidence melted away as she saw that Mrs.
Eden&rsquo;s tears were falling fast, and she ended with,
&lsquo;Only tell them, and we shall see what will
happen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Miss Lilias,&rsquo; said Mrs. Eden.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am very sorry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us hope that time and patience will set things
right,&rsquo; said Miss Weston, to relieve the embarrassment of
both parties.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your brother must soon see that Mr.
Devereux only wishes to do his duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alethea skilfully covered Lily&rsquo;s retreat, and the party
took leave of Mrs. Eden, and turned into their homeward path.</p>
<p>Lily at first seemed disposed to be silent, and Miss Weston
therefore amused herself with listening to the chatter of the
little girls as they walked on before them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are only thirty-six days to the holidays,&rsquo;
said Phyllis; &lsquo;Ada and I keep a paper in the nursery with
the account of the number of days.&nbsp; We shall be so glad when
Claude, and Maurice, and Redgie come home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are they not very boisterous?&rsquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Maurice,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;Maurice is like
nobody else.&nbsp; He takes up some scientific pursuit each time
he comes home, and cares for nothing else for some time, and then
quite forgets it.&nbsp; He is an odd-looking boy too, thick and
sturdy, with light flaxen hair, and dark, overhanging eyebrows,
and he makes the most extraordinary grimaces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Reginald?&rsquo; said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Redgie is a noble-looking fellow.&nbsp; But just
eleven, and taller than Jane.&nbsp; His complexion so fair, yet
fresh and boyish, and his eyes that beautiful blue that
Ada&rsquo;s are&mdash;real blue.&nbsp; Then his hair, in dark
brown waves, with a rich auburn shine.&nbsp; The old knights must
have been just like Redgie.&nbsp; And Claude&mdash;Oh! Miss
Weston, have you ever seen Claude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, but I have seen your eldest brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;William?&nbsp; Why, he has been in Canada these three
years.&nbsp; Where could you have seen him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At Brighton, about four years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! the year before he went.&nbsp; I remember that his
regiment was there.&nbsp; Well, it is curious that you should
know him; and did you ever hear of Harry, the brother that we
lost?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember Captain Mohun&rsquo;s being called away to
Oxford by his illness,&rsquo; said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes!&nbsp; William was the only one of us who was
with him, even papa was not there.&nbsp; His illness was so
short.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Alethea, &lsquo;I think it was on a
Tuesday that Captain Mohun left Brighton, and we saw his death in
the paper on Saturday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;William only arrived the evening that he died.&nbsp;
Papa was gone to Ireland to see about Cousin Rotherwood&rsquo;s
property.&nbsp; Robert, not knowing that, wrote to him at
Beechcroft; Eleanor forwarded the letter without opening it, and
so we knew nothing till Robert came to tell us that all was
over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without any preparation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With none.&nbsp; Harry had left home about ten days
before, quite well, and looking so handsome.&nbsp; You know what
a fine-looking person William is.&nbsp; Well, Harry was very like
him, only not so tall and strong, with the same clear hazel eyes,
and more pink in his cheeks&mdash;fairer altogether.&nbsp; Then
Harry wrote, saying that he had caught one of his bad
colds.&nbsp; We did not think much of it, for he was always
having coughs.&nbsp; We heard no more for a week, and then one
morning Eleanor was sent for out of the schoolroom, and there was
Robert come to tell us.&nbsp; Oh! it was such a
thunderbolt.&nbsp; This was what did the mischief.&nbsp; You know
papa and mamma being from home so long, the elder boys had no
settled place for the holidays; sometimes they stayed with one
friend, sometimes with another, and so no one saw enough of them
to find out how delicate poor Harry really was.&nbsp; I think
papa had been anxious the only winter they were at home together,
and Harry had been talked to and advised to take care; but in the
summer and autumn he was well, and did not think about it.&nbsp;
He went to Oxford by the coach&mdash;it was a bitterly cold
frosty day&mdash;there was a poor woman outside, shivering and
looking very ill, and Harry changed places with her.&nbsp; He was
horribly chilled, but thinking he had only a common cold, he took
no care.&nbsp; Robert, coming to Oxford about a week after, found
him very ill, and wrote to papa and William, but William scarcely
came in time.&nbsp; Harry just knew him, and that was all.&nbsp;
He could not speak, and died that night.&nbsp; Then William
stayed at Oxford to receive papa, and Robert came to tell
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must have been a terrible shock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a loss&mdash;he was so very good and clever.&nbsp;
Every one looked up to him&mdash;William almost as much as the
younger ones.&nbsp; He never was in any scrape, had all sorts of
prizes at Eton, besides getting his scholarship before he was
seventeen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whenever Lily could get Miss Weston alone, it was her way to
talk in this manner.&nbsp; She loved the sound of her own voice
so well, that she was never better satisfied than when engrossing
the whole conversation.&nbsp; Having nothing to talk of but her
books, her poor people, and her family, she gave her friend the
full benefit of all she could say on each subject, while Alethea
had kindness enough to listen with real interest to her long
rambling discourses, well pleased to see her happy.</p>
<p>The next time they met, Lilias told her all she knew or
imagined respecting Eleanor, and of her own debate with Claude,
and ended, &lsquo;Now, Miss Weston, tell me your opinion, which
would you choose for a sister, Eleanor or Emily?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have some experience of Miss Mohun&rsquo;s delightful
manners, and none of Mrs. Hawkesworth&rsquo;s, so I am no fair
judge,&rsquo; said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really have done justice to Eleanor&rsquo;s sterling
goodness,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now what should you
think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can hardly imagine greater proofs of affection than
Mrs. Hawkesworth has given you,&rsquo; said Miss Weston,
smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was because it was her duty,&rsquo; said
Lilias.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have only heard the facts, but you
cannot judge of her ways and looks.&nbsp; Now only think, when
Frank came home, after seven years of perils by field and
flood&mdash;there she rose up to receive him as if he had been
Mr. Nobody making a morning call.&nbsp; And all the time before
they were married, I do believe she thought more of showing Emily
how much tea we were to use in a week than anything
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps some people might have admired her
self-command,&rsquo; said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Self-command, the refuge of the insensible?&nbsp; And
now, I told you about dear Harry the other day.&nbsp; He was
Eleanor&rsquo;s especial brother, yet his death never seemed to
make any difference to her.&nbsp; She scarcely cried: she heard
our lessons as usual, talked in her quiet voice&mdash;showed no
tokens of feeling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was her health as good as before?&rsquo; asked Miss
Weston.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was not ill,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;if she had, I
should have been satisfied.&nbsp; She certainly could not take
long walks that winter, but she never likes walking.&nbsp; People
said she looked ill, but I do not know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I tell you what I gather from your
history?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then do not think me very perverse, if I say that
perhaps the grief she then repressed may have weighed down her
spirits ever since, so that you can hardly remember any
alteration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I cannot,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is
always the same, but then she ought to have been more cheerful
before his death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did not you lose him soon after your mother?&rsquo;
said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two whole years,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! and
aunt, Robert too, and Frank went to India the beginning of that
year; yes, there was enough to depress her, but I never thought
of grief going on in that quiet dull way for so many
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would prefer one violent burst, and then
forgetfulness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;but I should like
a little evidence of it.&nbsp; If it is really strong, it cannot
be hid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Little did Lily think of the grief that sat heavy upon the
spirit of Alethea, who answered&mdash;&lsquo;Some people can do
anything that they consider their duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Duty: what, are you a duty lover?&rsquo; exclaimed
Lilias.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never suspected it, because you are not
disagreeable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Alethea, laughing, &lsquo;your
compliment rather surprises me, for I thought you told me that
your brother Claude was on the duty side of the
question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He thinks he is,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;but love is
his real motive of action, as I can prove to you.&nbsp; Poor
Claude had a very bad illness when he was about three years old;
and ever since he has been liable to terrible headaches, and he
is not at all strong.&nbsp; Of course he cannot always study
hard, and when first he went to school, every one scolded him for
being idle.&nbsp; I really believe he might have done more, but
then he was so clever that he could keep up without any trouble,
and, as Robert says, that was a great temptation; but still papa
was not satisfied, because he said Claude could do better.&nbsp;
So said Harry.&nbsp; Oh! you cannot think what a person Harry
was, as high-spirited as William, and as gentle as Claude; and in
his kind way he used to try hard to make Claude exert himself,
but it never would do&mdash;he was never in mischief, but he
never took pains.&nbsp; Then Harry died, and when Claude came
home, and saw how changed things were, how gray papa&rsquo;s hair
had turned, and how silent and melancholy William had grown, he
set himself with all his might to make up to papa as far as he
could.&nbsp; He thought only of doing what Harry would have
wished, and papa himself says that he has done wonders.&nbsp; I
cannot see that Henry himself could have been more than Claude is
now; he has not spared himself in the least, his tutor says, and
he would have had the Newcastle Scholarship last year, if he had
not worked so hard that he brought on one of his bad illnesses,
and was obliged to come home.&nbsp; Now I am sure that he has
acted from love, for it was as much his duty to take pains while
Harry was alive as afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Miss Weston, &lsquo;but what
does he say himself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! he never will talk of himself,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you not overlooked one thing which may be the
truth,&rsquo; said Alethea, as if she was asking for information,
&lsquo;that duty and love may be identical?&nbsp; Is not St.
Paul&rsquo;s description of charity very like the duty to our
neighbour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The practice is the same, but not the theory,&rsquo;
said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, what is called duty, seems to me to be love doing
unpleasant work,&rsquo; said Miss Weston; &lsquo;love disguised
under another name, when obliged to act in a way which seems,
only seems, out of accordance with its real title.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is all very well for those who have love,&rsquo;
said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some have not who do their duty
conscientiously&mdash;another word which I hate, by the
bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have love in a rough coat, perhaps,&rsquo; said
Alethea, &lsquo;and I should expect it soon to put on a smoother
one.&rsquo;</p>

61</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SIR MAURICE</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Shall thought was his, in after time,<br />
Thus to be hitched into a rhyme;<br />
The simple sire could only boast<br />
That he was loyal to his cost,<br />
The banished race of kings revered,<br />
And lost his land.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> holidays arrived, and with them
the three brothers, for during the first few weeks of the Oxford
vacation Claude accompanied Lord Rotherwood on visits to some
college friends, and only came home the same day as the younger
ones.</p>
<p>Maurice did not long leave his sisters in doubt as to what was
to be his reigning taste, for as soon as dinner was over, he made
Jane find the volume of the Encyclop&aelig;dia containing
Entomology, and with his elbows on the table, proceeded to study
it so intently, that the young ladies gave up all hopes of
rousing him from it.&nbsp; Claude threw himself down on the sofa
to enjoy the luxury of a desultory talk with his sisters; and
Reginald, his head on the floor, and his heels on a chair, talked
loud and fast enough for all three, with very little regard to
what the damsels might be saying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Claude,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;you cannot think
how much we like Miss Weston, she lets us call her Alethea,
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here came an interruption from Mr. Mohun, who perceiving the
position of Reginald&rsquo;s dusty shoes, gave a loud
&lsquo;Ah&mdash;h!&rsquo; as if he was scolding a dog, and
ordered him to change them directly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, Phyl!&rsquo; said Reginald, kicking off his
shoes, &lsquo;just step up and bring my shippers, Rachel will
give them to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Away went Phyllis, well pleased to be her brother&rsquo;s
fag.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Redgie does not know the misfortune that
hangs over him,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Reginald, &lsquo;will not the Baron
let Viper come to the house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worse,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;Rachel is going
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rachel?&rsquo; cried Claude, starting up from the
sofa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rachel?&rsquo; said Maurice, without raising his
eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rachel!&nbsp; Rachel! botheration!&rsquo; roared
Reginald, with a wondrous caper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Rachel,&rsquo; said Emily; &lsquo;Rachel, who
makes so much of you, for no reason that I could ever discover,
but because you are the most troublesome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will never find any one to mend your jackets, and
dress your wounds like Rachel,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;and make
a baby of you instead of a great schoolboy.&nbsp; What will
become of you, Redgie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What will become of any of us?&rsquo; said Claude;
&lsquo;I thought Rachel was the mainspring of the
house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you quarrelled with her, Emily?&rsquo; said
Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;it is only that her
brother has lost his wife, and wants her to take care of his
children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Reginald, &lsquo;her master has lost
his wife, and wants her to take care of his children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot think what I shall do,&rsquo; said Ada;
&lsquo;I cry about it every night when I go to bed.&nbsp; What is
to be done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send her brother a new wife,&rsquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send him Emily,&rsquo; said Reginald; &lsquo;we could
spare her much better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only I don&rsquo;t wish him joy,&rsquo; said
Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I hope you wish me joy of my substitute,&rsquo;
said Emily; &lsquo;I do not think you would ever guess, but Lily,
after being in what Rachel calls quite a way, has persuaded every
one to let us have Esther Bateman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, the Baron?&rsquo; said Claude, in surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;is it not
delightful?&nbsp; He said at first, Emily was too inexperienced
to teach a young servant; but then we settled that Hannah should
be upper servant, and Esther will only have to wait upon Phyl and
Ada.&nbsp; Then he said Faith Longley was of a better set of
people, but I am sure it would give one the nightmare to see her
lumbering about the house, and then he talked it over with Robert
and with Rachel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And was not Rachel against it, or was she too kind to
her young ladies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! she was cross when she talked it over with
us,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;but we coaxed her over, and she told
the Baron it would do very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Robert?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was quite with us, for he likes Esther as much as I
do,&rsquo; said lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Lily,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;how can you say he
was quite with you, when he said he thought it would be better if
she was farther from home, and under some older
person?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but he allowed that she would be much safer here
than at home,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I thought she used to be the head of all the ill
behaviour in school,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that was in Eleanor&rsquo;s time,&rsquo; said Lily;
&lsquo;there was nothing to draw her out, she never was
encouraged; but since she has been in my class, and has found
that her wishes to do right are appreciated and met by affection,
she has been quite a new creature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since she has been in <span class="GutSmall">MY</span>
class,&rsquo; Claude repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Lily, with a slight blush, &lsquo;it
is just what Robert says.&nbsp; He told her, when he gave her her
prize Bible on Palm Sunday, that she had been going on very well,
but she must take great care when removed from those whose
influence now guided her, and who could he have meant but
me?&nbsp; And now she is to go on with me always.&nbsp; She will
be quite one of the old sort of faithful servants, who feel that
they owe everything to their masters, and will it not be pleasant
to have so sweet and expressive a face about the
house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do I know her face?&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh
yes!&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; She has black eyes, I think, and would be
pretty if she did not look pert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You provoking Claude!&rsquo; cried Lily, &lsquo;you are
as bad as Alethea, who never will say that Esther is the best
person for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was going to inquire for the all-for-love
principle,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;but I see it is in full
force.&nbsp; And how are the verses, Lily?&nbsp; Have you made a
poem upon Michael Moone, or Mohun, the actor, our uncle, whom I
discovered for you in Pepys&rsquo;s Memoirs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;but I have been
writing something about Sir Maurice, which you shall hear
whenever you are not in this horrid temper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next afternoon, as soon as luncheon was over, Lily drew
Claude out to his favourite place under the plane-tree, where she
proceeded to inflict her poem upon his patient ears, while he lay
flat upon the grass looking up to the sky; Emily and Jane had
promised to join them there in process of time, and the four
younger ones were, as usual, diverting themselves among the farm
buildings at the Old Court.</p>
<p>Lily began: &lsquo;I meant to have two parts about Sir Maurice
going out to fight when he was very young, and then about his
brothers being killed, and King Charles knighting him, and his
betrothed, Phyllis Crossthwayte, embroidering his black engrailed
cross on his banner, and then the taking the castle, and his
being wounded, and escaping, and Phyllis not thinking it right to
leave her father; but I have not finished that, so now you must
hear about his return home.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A romaunt in six cantos, entitled Woe
woe,<br />
By Miss Fanny F. known more commonly so,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>muttered Claude to himself; but as Lily did not understand or
know whence his quotation came, it did not hurt her feelings, and
she went merrily on:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the twenty-ninth of merry
May;<br />
Full cheerily shine the sunbeams to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their joyous light revealing<br />
Full many a troop in garments gay,<br />
With cheerful steps who take their way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the green hill and shady lane,<br />
While merry bells are pealing;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon in Beechcroft&rsquo;s holy fane<br />
The villagers are kneeling.<br />
Dreary and mournful seems the shrine<br />
Where sound their prayers and hymns divine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For every mystic ornament<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the rude spoiler&rsquo;s hand is rent;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarce is its ancient beauty traced<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In wood-work broken and defaced,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reft of each quaint device and rare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of foliage rich and mouldings fair;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet happy is each spirit there;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simple peasantry rejoice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the altar decked with care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear their ancient
Pastor&rsquo;s voice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reciting o&rsquo;er each well-known prayer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To view again his robe of white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hear the services aright;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more to chant their glorious Creed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thankful own their nation freed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From those who cast her glories down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And rent away her Cross and Crown.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A stranger knelt among the crowd,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And joined his voice in praises loud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when the holy rites had ceased,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Held converse with the aged Priest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then turned to join the village feast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, raised on the hill&rsquo;s summit green,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Maypole&rsquo;s flowery wreaths were seen;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the venerable yew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stranger stood the sports to view,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unmarked by all, for each was bent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On his own scheme of merriment,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On talking, laughing, dancing, playing&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There never was so blithe a Maying.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So thought each laughing maiden gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose head-gear bore the oaken spray;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So thought that hand of shouting boys,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unchecked in their best joy&mdash;in noise;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But gray-haired men, whose deep-marked scars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bore token of the civil wars,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hooded dames in cloaks of red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the blithe youngsters shook the head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gathering in eager clusters told<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How joyous were the days of old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Beechcroft&rsquo;s lords, those Barons bold,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came forth to join their vassals&rsquo; sport,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And here to hold their rustic court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Throned in the ancient chair you see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath our noble old yew tree.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! all empty stands the throne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reserved for Mohun&rsquo;s race alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the old folks can only tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the good lords who ruled so well.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I bethink me of the time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last before those years of crime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When with his open hearty cheer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The good old squire was sitting here.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas then,&rdquo; another voice
replied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That brave young Master Maurice tried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pitch the ball with Andrew Grey&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We ne&rsquo;er shall see so blithe a day&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the young squires have long
been dead.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Master Webb,&rdquo; quoth Andrew Grey,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Young Master Maurice safely
fled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At least so all the Greenwoods say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Walter Greenwood with him went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To share his master&rsquo;s banishment;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now King Charles is ruling here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our own good landlord may be near.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Small hope of that,&rdquo; the old man
said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sadly shook his hoary head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir Maurice died beyond the sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Last of his noble line was he.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look, Master Webb!&rdquo; he turned, and
there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stranger sat in Mohun&rsquo;s chair;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At ease he sat, and smiled to scan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The face of each astonished man;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then on the ground he laid aside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His plumed hat and mantle wide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One moment, Andrew deemed he knew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those glancing eyes of hazel hue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But the sunk cheek, the figure spare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lines of white that streak the hair&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How can this he the stripling gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Erst, victor in the sports of May?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full twenty years of cheerful toil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And labour on his native soil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Andrew&rsquo;s head had left no trace&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The summer&rsquo;s sun, the
winter&rsquo;s storm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They had but ruddier made his face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More hard his hand, more strong
his form.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth from the wandering, whispering crowd,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A farmer came, and spoke aloud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With rustic bow and welcome fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But with a hesitating air&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He told how custom well preserved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The throne for Mohun&rsquo;s race reserved;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stranger laughed, &ldquo;What, Harrington,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou forgot thy landlord&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Loud was the cry, and blithe the shout,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Beechcroft hill that now rang out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And still remembered is the day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That merry twenty-ninth of May,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When to his father&rsquo;s home returned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That knight, whose glory well was earned.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In poverty and banishment,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His prime of manhood had been spent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A wanderer, scorned by Charles&rsquo;s court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One faithful servant his support.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, he seeks his home forlorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Broken in health, with sorrow worn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And two short years just passed away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Between that joyous meeting-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sad eve when Beechcroft&rsquo;s bell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tolled forth Sir Maurice&rsquo;s funeral knell;<br
/>
And Phyllis, whose love was so constant and tried,<br />
Was a widow the year she was Maurice&rsquo;s bride;<br />
Yet the path of the noble and true-hearted knight,<br />
Was brilliant with honour, and glory, and light,<br />
And still his descendants shall sing of the fame<br />
Of Sir Maurice de Mohun, the pride of his name.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;It is a pity they should sing of it in such lines as
those last four,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me see, I
like your bringing in the real names, though I doubt whether any
but Greenwood could have been found here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! here come Emily and Jane,&rsquo; said Lily,
&lsquo;let me put it away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very much afraid of Jane,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Jane has no feeling for poetry,&rsquo; said Lily,
with simplicity, which made her brother smile.</p>
<p>Jane and Emily now came up, the former with her work, the
latter with a camp-stool and a book.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wonder,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;where those boys are!&nbsp; By
the bye, what character did they bring home from
school?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The same as usual,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Maurice&rsquo;s mind only half given to his work, and
Redgie&rsquo;s whole mind to his play.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maurice&rsquo;s talent does not lie in the direction of
Latin and Greek,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;it is nonsense to make him
learn it, and so he says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he would say the same of mathematics and
mechanics, if as great a point were made of them,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; said Claude; &lsquo;he has more
notion of them than of Latin verses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are on my side,&rsquo; said Jane,
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I say so?&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the use
of his knowing those stupid languages?&nbsp; I am sure it is
wasting time not to improve such a genius as he has for mechanics
and natural history.&nbsp; Now, Claude, I wish you would
answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was waiting till you had done,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you not think it nonsense?&rsquo; persisted
Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I respect my father&rsquo;s opinion,&rsquo;
said Claude, letting himself fall on the grass, as if he had done
with the subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;that sounds like a good
little boy of five years old!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you have some opinion of your own,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I wish you would give it,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Emily,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;have you
brought anything to read?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But your opinion, Claude,&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am sure you think with me, only you are too grand, and
too correct to say so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude made no answer, but Jane saw she was wrong by his
countenance; before she could say anything more, however, they
were interrupted by a great outcry from the Old Court
regions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;I thought it was a long
time since we had heard anything of those uproarious
mortals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope there is nothing the matter,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;I hear Redgie&rsquo;s
laugh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye, but among that party,&rsquo; said Emily,
&lsquo;Redgie&rsquo;s laugh is not always a proof of peace: they
are too much in the habit of acting the boys and the
frogs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were better off,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;with the
gentle Claude, as Miss Middleton used to call him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Molly, as William used to call him with more
propriety,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;not half so well worth
playing with as such a fellow as Redgie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not even for young ladies?&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Phyllis and Ada are much the better for being
teased,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am convinced that I
never did my duty by you in that respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There were others to do it for you,&rsquo; said
Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harry never teased,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;and
William scorned us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His teasing was all performed upon Claude,&rsquo; said
Lily, &lsquo;and a great shame it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;only an
injudicious attempt to put a little life into a
tortoise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A bad comparison,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;but what is
all this?&nbsp; Here come the children in dismay!&nbsp; What is
the matter, my dear child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was addressed to Phyllis, who was the first to come up at
full speed, sobbing, and out of breath, &lsquo;Oh, the
dragon-fly!&nbsp; Oh, do not let him kill it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The dragon-fly, the poor dear blue dragon-fly!&rsquo;
screamed Adeline, hiding her face in Emily&rsquo;s lap,
&lsquo;Oh, do not let him kill it! he is holding it; he is
hurting it!&nbsp; Oh, tell him not!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I caught it,&rsquo; said Phyllis, &lsquo;but not to
have it killed.&nbsp; Oh, take it away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fine rout, indeed, you chicken,&rsquo; said Reginald;
&lsquo;I know a fellow who ate up five horse-stingers one morning
before breakfast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stingers!&rsquo; said Phyllis, &lsquo;they do not sting
anything, pretty creatures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you I would catch the old pony and put it on him
to try,&rsquo; said Reginald.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Maurice came up at his leisure, holding his
prize by the wings.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look what a beautiful Libellulla
Puella,&rsquo; said he to Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A demoiselle dragon-fly,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;what
a beauty! what are you going to do with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put it into my museum,&rsquo; said Maurice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here, Jane, put it under this flower-pot, and take care of
it, while I fetch something to kill it with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Maurice, do not!&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One good squeeze,&rsquo; said Reginald.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
will do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How came you be so cruel?&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, a squeeze will not do,&rsquo; said Maurice;
&lsquo;it would spoil its beauty; I must put it ever the fumes of
carbonic acid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maurice, you really must not,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now do not, dear Maurice,&rsquo; said Ada,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s a dear boy; I will give you such a
kiss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense; get out of the way,&rsquo; said Maurice,
turning away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Maurice, this is most horrid cruelty,&rsquo; said
Lily; &lsquo;what right have you to shorten the brief, happy life
which&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; interrupted Maurice, &lsquo;if you make
such a fuss about killing it, I will stick a pin through it into
a cork, and let it shift for itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Phyllis ran away to the other end of the garden, sat down
and sobbed, Ada screamed and argued, Emily complained, Lily
exhorted Claude to interfere, while Reginald stood laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such useless cruelty,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Useless!&rsquo; said Maurice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray how is
any one to make a collection of natural objects without killing
things?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not see the use of a collection,&rsquo; said Lily;
&lsquo;you can examine the creatures and let them go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a young lady&rsquo;s tender-hearted notion,&rsquo;
said Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who ever heard of a man of science managing in such a
ridiculous way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Man of science!&rsquo; exclaimed Lily, &lsquo;when he
will have forgotten by next Christmas that insects ever
existed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not convenient to hear this speech, so Maurice turned
an empty flower-pot over his prisoner, and left it in
Jane&rsquo;s care while he went to fetch the means of
destruction, probably choosing the lawn for the place of
execution, in order to show his contempt for his sisters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fair damsel in boddice blue,&rsquo; said Lily, peeping
in at the hole at the top of the flower-pot, &lsquo;I wish I
could avert your melancholy fate.&nbsp; I am very sorry for you,
but I cannot help it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might help it now, at any rate,&rsquo; muttered
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;I know Monsieur Maurice
too well to arouse his wrath so justly.&nbsp; If you choose to
release the pretty creature, I shall be charmed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You forget that I am in charge,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a carriage coming to the front gate,&rsquo;
cried Ada.&nbsp; &lsquo;Emily, may I go into the
drawing-room?&nbsp; Oh, Jenny, will you undo my brown holland
apron?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is right, little mincing Miss,&rsquo; said
Reginald, with a low bow; &lsquo;how fine we are
to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How visitors break into the afternoon,&rsquo; said
Emily, with a languid turn of her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jenny, brownie,&rsquo; called Maurice from his bedroom
window, &lsquo;I want the sulphuric acid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane sprang up and ran into the house, though her sisters
called after her, that she would come full upon the company in
the hall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They shall not catch me here,&rsquo; cried Reginald,
rushing off into the shrubbery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you coming in, Claude?&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send Ada to call me, if there is any one worth
seeing,&rsquo; said Claude</p>
<p>&lsquo;They will see you from the window,&rsquo; said
Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;no one ever found me out
last summer, under these friendly branches.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old butler, Joseph, now showed himself on the terrace; and
the young ladies, knowing that he had no intention of crossing
the lawn, hastened to learn from him who their visitors were, and
entered the house.&nbsp; Just then Phyllis came running back from
the kitchen garden, and without looking round, or perceiving
Claude, she took up the flower-pot and released the captive,
which, unconscious of its peril, rested on a blade of grass,
vibrating its gauzy wings and rejoicing in the restored
sunbeams.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fly away, fly away, you pretty creature,&rsquo; said
Phyllis; &lsquo;make haste, or Maurice will come and catch you
again.&nbsp; I wish I had not given you such a fright.&nbsp; I
thought you would have been killed, and a pin stuck all through
that pretty blue and black body of yours.&nbsp; Oh! that would be
dreadful.&nbsp; Make haste and go away!&nbsp; I would not have
caught you, you beautiful thing, if I had known what he wanted to
do.&nbsp; I thought he only wanted to look at your beautiful
body, like a little bit of the sky come down to look at the
flowers, and your delicate wings, and great shining eyes.&nbsp;
Oh! I am very glad God made you so beautiful.&nbsp; Oh! there is
Maurice coming.&nbsp; I must blow upon you to make you go.&nbsp;
Oh, that is right&mdash;up quite high in the air&mdash;quite
safe,&rsquo; and she clapped her hands as the dragon-fly rose in
the air, and disappeared behind the laurels, just as Maurice and
Reginald emerged from the shrubbery, the former with a bottle in
his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, where is the Libellulla?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The dragon-fly?&rsquo; said Phyllis.&nbsp; &lsquo;I let
it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sold, Maurice!&rsquo; cried Reginald, laughing at his
brother&rsquo;s disaster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my word, Phyl, you are very kind!&rsquo; said
Maurice, angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had known you were such an
ill-natured crab&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Maurice dear, don&rsquo;t say so,&rsquo;
exclaimed Phyllis.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought I might let it out
because I caught it myself; and I told you I did not catch it for
you to kill; Maurice, indeed, I am sorry I vexed you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What else did you do it for?&rsquo; said Maurice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is horrid not to be able to leave one&rsquo;s things a
minute&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I did not know the dragon-fly belonged to you,
Maurice,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a puzzler, Mohun senior,&rsquo; said
Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Redgie, do get Maurice to leave off being angry
with me,&rsquo; implored his sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will leave off being angry,&rsquo; said Maurice,
seeing his advantage, &lsquo;if you will promise never to let out
my things again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think I can promise,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, you can,&rsquo; said Reginald, &lsquo;you know
they are not his.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Promise you will not let out any insects I may
get,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;or I shall say you are as cross
as two sticks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Maurice,&rsquo; said Phyllis,
&lsquo;I do wish you would not make me promise, for I do not
think I <i>can</i> keep it, for I cannot bear to see the
beautiful live things killed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Maurice, fiercely, &lsquo;I am
very angry indeed, you naughty child; promise&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; said Phyllis, beginning to cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;I will not speak to
you all day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; shouted Reginald, &lsquo;we will only
treat her like the horse-stinger; you wanted a puella,
Maurice&mdash;here is one for you, here, give her a dose of the
turpentine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Maurice, advancing with his bottle;
&lsquo;and do you take the poker down to Naylor&rsquo;s to be
sharpened, it will just do to stick through her back.&nbsp; Oh!
no, not Naylor&rsquo;s&mdash;the girls have made a hash there, as
they do everything else; but we will settle her before they come
out again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis screamed and begged for mercy&mdash;her last ally had
deserted her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Promise!&rsquo; cried the boys.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; was all her answer.</p>
<p>Reginald caught her and held her fast, Maurice advanced upon
her, she struggled, and gave a scream of real terror.&nbsp; The
matter was no joke to any one but Reginald, for Maurice was very
angry and really meant to frighten her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hands off, boys, I will not have her bullied,&rsquo;
said Claude, half rising.</p>
<p>Maurice gave a violent start, Reginald looked round laughing,
and exclaimed, &lsquo;Who would have thought of Claude sneaking
there?&rsquo; and Phyllis ran to the protecting arm, which he
stretched out.&nbsp; To her great surprise, he drew her to him,
and kissed her forehead, saying, &lsquo;Well done,
Phyl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I knew he was not going to hurt me,&rsquo; said
Phyllis, still panting from the struggle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure not,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;I only
meant to have a little fun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude, with his arm still round his sister&rsquo;s waist,
gave Maurice a look, expressing, &lsquo;Is that the truth?&rsquo;
and Reginald tumbled head over heels, exclaiming, &lsquo;I would
not have been Phyl just them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ada now came running up to them, saying, &lsquo;Maurice and
Redgie, you are to come in; Mr. and Mrs. Burnet heard your
voices, and begged to see you, because they never saw you last
holidays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More&rsquo;s the pity they should see us now,&rsquo;
said Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not go,&rsquo; said Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa is there, and he sent for you,&rsquo; said
Ada.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Plague,&rsquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See what you get by making such a row,&rsquo; said
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you had been as orderly members of
society as I am&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but Claude,&rsquo; said Ada, &lsquo;papa told me to
see if I could find you.&nbsp; Dear Claude, I wish,&rsquo; she
proceeded, taking his hand, and looking engaging, &lsquo;I wish
you would put your arm round me as you do round Phyl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not worth it, Ada,&rsquo; said Reginald, and
Claude did not contradict him.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE BROTHERS</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But smiled to hear the creatures he had
known<br />
So long were now in class and order shown&mdash;<br />
Genus and species.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it meet,&rdquo; said he,<br />
&ldquo;This creature&rsquo;s name should one so sounding
be&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis but a fly, though first-born of the spring,<br />
Bombylius Majus, dost thou call the thing?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not till Sunday, that
Lily&rsquo;s eager wish was fulfilled, of introducing her friend
and her brothers; but, as she might have foreseen, their first
meeting did not make the perfections of either party very clear
to the other.&nbsp; Claude never spoke to strangers more than he
could help, Maurice and Reginald were in the room only a short
time; so that the result of Miss Weston&rsquo;s observations,
when communicated in reply to Lily&rsquo;s eager inquiries, was
only that Claude was very like his father and eldest brother,
Reginald very handsome, and Maurice looked like a very funny
fellow.</p>
<p>On Monday, Reginald and Maurice were required to learn what
they had always refused to acknowledge, that the holidays were
not intended to be spent in idleness.&nbsp; A portion of each
morning was to be devoted to study, Claude having undertaken the
task of tutor&mdash;and hard work he found it; and much did Lily
pity him, when, as not unfrequently happened, the summons to the
children&rsquo;s dinner would bring him from the study, looking
thoroughly fagged&mdash;Maurice in so sulky a mood that he would
hardly deign to open his lips&mdash;Reginald talking fast enough,
indeed, but only to murmur at his duties in terms, which, though
they made every one laugh, were painful to hear.&nbsp; Then
Claude would take his brothers back to the study, and not appear
for an hour or more, and when he did come forth, it was with a
bad headache.&nbsp; Sometimes, as if to show that it was only
through their own fault that their tasks were wearisome, one or
both boys would finish quite early, when Reginald would betake
himself to the schoolroom and employ his idle time in making it
nearly impossible for Ada and Phyllis to learn, by talking,
laughing, teasing the canary, overturning everything in pursuing
wasps, making Emily fretful by his disobedience, and then
laughing at her, and, in short, proving his right to the title he
had given himself at the end of the only letter he had written
since he first went to school, and which he had subscribed,
&lsquo;Your affectionate bother, R. Mohun.&rsquo;&nbsp; So that,
for their own sake, all would have preferred the inattentive
mornings.</p>
<p>Lily often tried to persuade Claude to allow her to tell her
father how troublesome the boys were, but never with any
effect.&nbsp; He once took up a book he had been using with them,
and pointing to the name in the first page, in writing, which
Lily knew full well, &lsquo;Henry Mohun,&rsquo; she perceived
that he meant to convince her that it was useless to try to
dissuade him, as he thought the patience and forbearance his
brother had shown to him must be repaid by his not shrinking from
the task he had imposed upon himself with his young brothers,
though he was often obliged to sit up part of the night to pursue
his own studies.</p>
<p>If Claude had rather injudiciously talked too much to Lilias
of &lsquo;her principle,&rsquo; and thus kept it alive in her
mind, yet his example might have made its fallacy evident.&nbsp;
She believed that what she called love had been the turning point
in his character, that it had been his earnest desire to follow
in Henry&rsquo;s steps, and so try to comfort his father for his
loss, that had roused him from his indolence; but she was
beginning to see that nothing but a sense of duty could have kept
up the power of that first impulse for six years.&nbsp; Lily
began to enter a little into his principle, and many things that
occurred during these holidays made her mistrust her former
judgment.&nbsp; She saw that without the unvarying principle of
right and wrong, fraternal love itself would fail in outward acts
and words.&nbsp; Forbearance, though undeniably a branch of love,
could not exist without constant remembrance of duty; and which
of them did not sometimes fail in kindness, meekness, and
patience?&nbsp; Did Emily show that softness, which was her most
agreeable characteristic, in her whining reproofs&mdash;in her
complaints that &lsquo;no one listened to a word she
said&rsquo;&mdash;in her refusal to do justice even to those who
had vainly been seeking for peace?&nbsp; Did Lily herself show
any of her much valued love, by the sharp manner in which she
scolded the boys for roughness towards herself? or for language
often used by them on purpose to make her displeasure a matter of
amusement?&nbsp; She saw that her want of command of temper was a
failure both in love and duty, and when irritated, the thought of
duty came sooner to her aid than the feeling of love.</p>
<p>And Maurice and Reginald were really very provoking.&nbsp;
Maurice loved no amusement better than teasing his sisters, and
this was almost the only thing in which Reginald agreed with
him.&nbsp; Reginald was affectionate, but too reckless and
violent not to be very troublesome, and he too often flew into a
passion if Maurice attempted to laugh at him; the little girls
were often frightened and made unhappy; Phyllis would scream and
roar, and Ada would come sobbing to Emily, to be comforted after
some rudeness of Reginald&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was not very often
that quarrels went so far, but many a time in thought, word, and
deed was the rule of love transgressed, and more than once did
Emily feel ready to give up all her dignity, to have
Eleanor&rsquo;s hand over the boys once more.&nbsp; Claude,
finding that he could do much to prevent mischief, took care not
to leave the two boys long together with the elder girls.&nbsp;
They were far more inoffensive when separate, as Maurice never
practised his tormenting tricks when no one was present to laugh
with him, and Reginald was very kind to Phyllis and Ada, although
somewhat rude.</p>
<p>It was a day or two after they returned that Phyllis was
leaning on the window-sill in the drawing-room, watching a
passing shower, and admiring the soft bright tints of a rainbow
upon the dark gray mass of cloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do set my bow in
the cloud,&rsquo; repeated she to herself over and over again,
until Adeline entering the room, she eagerly exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh
Ada, come and look at this beautiful rainbow, green, and pink,
and purple.&nbsp; A double one, with so many stripes, Ada.&nbsp;
See, there is a little bit more green.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no green in a rainbow,&rsquo; said Ada.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But look, Ada, that is green.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not real green.&nbsp; Blue, red, and yellow are
the pragmatic colours,&rsquo; said Ada, with a most triumphant
air.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now are not they, Maurice?&rsquo; said she,
turning to her brother, who was, as usual, deep in
entomology.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pragmatic, you foolish child,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Prismatic you mean.&nbsp; I am glad you remember what I
tell you, however; I think I might teach you some science in
time.&nbsp; You are right in saying that blue, red, and yellow
are the prismatic colours.&nbsp; Now do you know what causes a
rainbow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is to show there is never to be another
flood,&rsquo; said Phyllis, gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I did not mean that,&rsquo; said Maurice,
addressing himself to Ada, whose love of hard words made him deem
her a promising pupil, and whom he could lecture without
interruption.&nbsp; &lsquo;The rainbow is caused
by&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Maurice!&rsquo; exclaimed Phyllis, remaining with
mouth wide open.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The rainbow is occasioned by the refraction of the rays
of the sun in the drops of water of which a cloud is
composed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Maurice!&rsquo; again said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what do you keep on &ldquo;but, Mauricing,&rdquo;
about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Maurice, I thought it said, &ldquo;I do set my bow
in the cloud.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is not that right?&nbsp; I will
look.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that, but I know the iris, or rainbow, is a
natural phenomenon occasioned by the refraction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Maurice, I can&rsquo;t bear you to say
that;&rsquo; and poor Phyllis sat down and began to cry.</p>
<p>Ada interfered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, Maurice, you believe the
Bible, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This last speech was heard by Lilias, who just now entered the
room, and greatly surprised her.&nbsp; &lsquo;What can you be
talking of?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only some nonsense of the children&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said
Maurice, shortly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But only hear what he says,&rsquo; cried Ada.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He says the rainbow was not put there to show there is
never to be another flood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Lily,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;I do not think
there is much use in talking to you, but I wish you to understand
that all I said was, that the rainbow, or iris, is a natural
phenomenon occasioned by the refraction of the
solar&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will certainly bewilder yourself into something
dreadful with that horrid science,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What is the matter with Phyl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only crying because of what I said,&rsquo; answered
Maurice.&nbsp; &lsquo;So childish, and you are just as
bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But do you mean to say,&rsquo; exclaimed Lily,
&lsquo;that you set this human theory above the authority of the
Bible?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is common sense,&rsquo; said Maurice; &lsquo;I could
make a rainbow any day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Phyllis cried the more, and Lily looked infinitely
shocked.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is philosophy and vain deceit,&rsquo;
said she; &lsquo;the very thing that tends to
infidelity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;it is universally
allowed,&rsquo; said the boy doggedly.</p>
<p>It was fortunate that the next person who entered the room was
Claude, and all at once he was appealed to by the four
disputants, Lily the loudest and most vehement.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Claude, listen to him, and tell him to throw away these
hateful new lights, which lead to everything that is
shocking!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen to him, with three ladies talking at
once?&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, not Phyl&mdash;her
tears only are eloquent; but it is a mighty war about the token
of peace and <i>love</i>, Lily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The love would be in driving these horrible
philosophical speculations out of Maurice&rsquo;s mind,&rsquo;
said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No one can ever drive out the truth,&rsquo; said
Maurice, with provoking coolness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let
her scratch out my eyes, Claude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not so sure of that maxim,&rsquo; said
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Truth is chiefly injured&mdash;I mean, her
force weakened, by her own supporters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you agree with me,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;as,
in fact, every rational person must.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are with me,&rsquo; said Lily, in the same
breath; &lsquo;and you will convince Maurice of the danger of
this nonsense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Umph,&rsquo; sighed Claude, throwing himself into his
father&rsquo;s arm-chair, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis a Herculean
labour!&nbsp; It seems I agree with you both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, every Christian must be with me, who has not lost
his way in a mist of his own raising,&rsquo; said Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;that
these colours are not produced by refraction?&nbsp; Look at them
on those prisms;&rsquo; and he pointed to an old-fashioned lustre
on the chimney-piece.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope this is not a part of
the Christian faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care, Maurice,&rsquo; and Claude&rsquo;s eyes were
bent upon him in a manner that made him shrink.&nbsp; And he
added, &lsquo;Of course I do believe that chapter about
Noah.&nbsp; I only meant that the immediate cause of the rainbow
is the refraction of light.&nbsp; I did not mean to be
irreverent, only the girls took me up in such a way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I know well enough that you can make those colours
by light on drops of water,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you agreed all the time,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; added Lily, &lsquo;I never liked to know
it; for it always seemed to be explaining away the Bible, and I
cannot bear not to regard that lovely bow as a constant
miracle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will remember,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;that some
commentators say it should be, &ldquo;I <i>have</i> set my bow in
the cloud,&rdquo; which would make what already existed become a
token for the future.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like that explanation,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Others say,&rsquo; added Claude, &lsquo;that there
might have been no rain at all till the windows of heaven were
opened at the flood, and, in that case, the first recurrence of
rain must have greatly alarmed Noah&rsquo;s family, if they had
not been supported and cheered by the sight of the
rainbow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is reasonable,&rsquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate reason applied to revelation,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a happier state of mind which does not seek to
apply it,&rsquo; said Claude, looking at Phyllis, who had dried
her tears, and stood in the window gazing at him, in the happy
certainty that he was setting all right.&nbsp; Maurice respected
Claude for his science as much as his character, and did not make
game of this observation as he would if it had been made by one
of his sisters, but he looked at him with an odd expression of
perplexity.&nbsp; &lsquo;You do not think ignorant credulity
better than reasonable belief?&rsquo; said he at length.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not I only who think most highly of child-like
unquestioning faith, Maurice,&rsquo; said
Claude&mdash;&lsquo;faith, that is based upon love and
reverence,&rsquo; added he to Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;But come, the
shower is over, and philosophers, or no philosophers, I invite
you to walk in the wood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;I daresay I can find
some of the Arachne species there.&nbsp; By the bye, Claude, do
you think papa would let me have a piece of plate-glass, eighteen
by twenty, to cover my case of insects?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ask, and you will discover,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Maurice began the next morning at breakfast,
&lsquo;Papa, may I have a piece of plate-glass, eighteen
by&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But no one heard, for Emily was at the moment saying,
&lsquo;The Westons are to dine here to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude and Maurice both looked blank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I persuaded papa to ask the Westons,&rsquo; said Lily,
&lsquo;because I am determined that Claude shall like
Alethea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must expect that I shall not, you have given me so
many orders on the subject,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care it has not the same effect as to tell Maurice
to like a book,&rsquo; said Emily; &lsquo;nothing makes his
aversion so certain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except when he takes it up by mistake, and forgets that
it has been recommended to him,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care, Redgie, with your knife; don&rsquo;t put out
my eyes in your ardour against that wretched wasp.&nbsp; Wat
Greenwood may well say &ldquo;there is a terrible sight of
waspses this year.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I killed twenty-nine yesterday,&rsquo; said
Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I will tell you what I saw,&rsquo; said Phyllis;
&lsquo;I was picking up apples, and the wasps were flying all
round, and there came a hornet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vespa Crabro!&rsquo; cried Maurice; &lsquo;oh, I must
have one!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what of the hornet?&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; resumed Phyllis,
&lsquo;he saw a wasp flying, and so he went up in the air, and
pounced on the poor wasp as the hawk did on Jane&rsquo;s
bantam.&nbsp; So then he hung himself up to the branch of a tree
by one of his legs, and held the wasp with the other five, and
began to pack it up.&nbsp; First he bit off the yellow tail, then
the legs, and threw them away, and then there was nothing left
but the head, and so he flew away with it to his nest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which way did he go?&rsquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To the Old Court,&rsquo; answered Phyllis; &lsquo;I
think the nest is in the roof of the old cow-house, for they were
flying in and out there yesterday, and one was eating out the
wood from the old rails.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;you must show me a
hornet hawking for wasps before the nest is taken, Phyllis; I
suppose you have seen the wasps catching flies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, papa! but they pack them up quite
differently.&nbsp; They do not hang by one leg, but they sit down
quite comfortably on a branch while they bite off the wings and
legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, Maurice,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;I had
rather hear of one such well-observed fact than of a dozen of
your hard names and impaled insects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis looked quite radiant with delight at his
approbation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, papa,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;may I have a
piece of plate-glass, eighteen by twenty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you observe facts in natural history, perhaps I
may say something to your entomology,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, papa, all my insects will be spoilt if I may not
have a piece of glass, eighteen by&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the arrival of the post-bag, which Jane,
as usual, opened.&nbsp; &lsquo;A letter from Rotherwood,&rsquo;
said she; &lsquo;I hope he is coming at last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is,&rsquo; said Claude, reading the letter,
&lsquo;but only from Saturday till Wednesday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He never gave us so little of his good company as he
has this summer,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will have them all in the autumn, to comfort
you,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;for he hereby announces the
marvellous fact, that the Marchioness sends him to see if the
castle is fit to receive her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you sure he is not only believing what he
wishes?&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he will gain his point at last,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How stupid of him to stay no longer!&rsquo; said
Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he has some scheme for this vacation,&rsquo;
said Claude, &lsquo;and I suppose he means to crowd all the
Beechcroft diversions of a whole summer into those few
days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;I wish him to know
the Carringtons; invite them and the Westons to dinner on
Tuesday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried Reginald.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
will be so jolly to have him to take wasps&rsquo; nests; and may
I go out rabbit-shooting with him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And may I carry a gun?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it is not loaded,&rsquo; said his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I would do no mischief,&rsquo; said
Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me give you one piece of advice, Reginald,&rsquo;
said Mr. Mohun, with a mysterious air&mdash;&lsquo;never make
rash promises.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias was rather disappointed in her hopes that Miss Weston
and Claude would become better acquainted.&nbsp; At dinner the
conversation was almost entirely between the elder gentlemen;
Claude scarcely spoke, except when referred to by his father or
Mr. Devereux.&nbsp; Miss Weston never liked to incur the danger
of having to repeat her insignificant speeches to a deaf ear, and
being interested in the discussion that was going on, she by no
means seconded Lily&rsquo;s attempt to get up an under-current of
talk.&nbsp; In general, Lily liked to listen to conversation in
silence, but she was now in very high spirits, and could not be
quiet; fortunately, she had no interest in the subject the
gentlemen were discussing, so that she could not meddle with
that, and finding Alethea silent and Claude out of reach, she
turned to Reginald, and talked and tittered with him all
dinner-time.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room she had it all her own way, and talked
enough for all the sisters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you heard that Cousin Rotherwood is
coming?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you said so before dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We hope,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;that you and Mr.
Weston will dine here on Tuesday.&nbsp; The Carringtons are
coming, and a few others.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Alethea; &lsquo;I daresay papa
will be very glad to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you ever seen Rotherwood?&rsquo; said Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not expect much,&rsquo; said Lily, laughing, though
she knew not why; &lsquo;he is a very little fellow; no one would
suppose him to be twenty, he has such a boyish look.&nbsp; Then
he never sits down&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Literally?&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Literally,&rsquo; persisted Lily; &lsquo;such a quick
person you never did see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he at Oxford?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes! it was all papa&rsquo;s doing that he was sent
to Eton.&nbsp; Papa is his guardian.&nbsp; Aunt Rotherwood never
would have parted with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is the only son,&rsquo; interposed Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle Rotherwood put him quite in papa&rsquo;s power;
Aunt Rotherwood wanted to keep him at home with a tutor, and what
she would have made of him I cannot think,&rsquo; said Lily; and
regardless of Emily&rsquo;s warning frowns, and Alethea&rsquo;s
attempt to change the subject, she went on: &lsquo;When he was
quite a child he used to seem a realisation of all the naughty
Dicks and Toms in story-books.&nbsp; Miss Middleton had a perfect
horror of his coming here, for he would mind no one, and played
tricks and drew Claude into mischief; but he is quite altered
since papa had the management of him&mdash;Oh! such talks as papa
has had with Aunt Rotherwood&mdash;do you know, papa says no one
knows what it is to lose a father but those who have the care of
his children, and Aunt Rotherwood is so provoking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Alethea determined to put an end to this oration, and to
Emily&rsquo;s great relief, she cut short the detail of Lady
Rotherwood&rsquo;s offences by saying, &lsquo;Do you think Faith
Longley likely to suit us, if we took her to help the
housemaid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you thinking of taking her?&rsquo; cried
Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, for steady, stupid household work, Faith
would do very well; she is just the stuff to make a servant
of&mdash;&ldquo;for dulness ever must be regular&rdquo;&mdash;I
mean for those who like mere steadiness better than anything more
lovable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Alethea said, laughing, &lsquo;I must confess my respect
for that quality,&rsquo; Mr. Devereux and Claude entered the
room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Robert!&rsquo; cried Lily, &lsquo;Mrs. Weston is
going to take Faith Longley to help the housemaid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are travelling too fast, Lily,&rsquo; said Alethea,
&lsquo;she is only going to think about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be very glad,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux,
&lsquo;that Faith should have a good place; the Longleys are very
respectable people, and they behaved particularly well in
refusing to let this girl go and live with some dissenters at
Stoney Bridge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like what I have seen of the girl very much,&rsquo;
said Miss Weston.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In spite of her sad want of feeling,&rsquo; said
Robert, smiling, as he looked at Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! she is a good work-a-day sort of person,&rsquo;
said Lily, &lsquo;like all other poor people, hard and
passive.&nbsp; Now, do not set up your eyebrows, Claude, I am
quite serious, there is no warmth about any
except&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So this is what Lily is come to!&rsquo; cried Emily;
&lsquo;the grand supporter of the poor on poetical
principles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The poor not affectionate!&rsquo; said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not, compared within people whose minds and affections
have been cultivated,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now just
hear what Mrs. Wall said to me only yesterday; she asked for a
black stuff gown out of the clothing club, &ldquo;for,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;I had a misfortune, Miss;&rdquo; I thought it
would be, &ldquo;and tore my gown,&rdquo; but it was, &ldquo;I
had a misfortune, Miss, and lost my brother.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very harsh conclusion on very slight grounds,&rsquo;
said Mr. Devereux.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prove the contrary,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Facts would scarcely demonstrate it either way,&rsquo;
said Mr. Devereux.&nbsp; &lsquo;They would only prove what was
the case with individuals who chanced to come in our way, and if
we are seldom able to judge of the depth of feeling of those with
whom we are familiar, how much less of those who feel our
presence a restraint.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Intense feeling mocks restraint,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Violent, not intense,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Besides, you talk of cultivating the affections.&nbsp; Now
what do you mean?&nbsp; Exercising them, or talking about
them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;the affection of a poor
person is more tried; we blame a poor man for letting his old
mother go to the workhouse, without considering how many of us
would do the same, if we had as little to live upon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still,&rsquo; said Alethea, &lsquo;the same man who
would refuse to maintain her if poor, would not bear with her
infirmities if rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are the poor never infirm and peevish?&rsquo; said Mr.
Devereux.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! how much worse it must be to bear with ill-temper
in poverty,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;when we think it quite
wonderful to see a young lady kind and patient with a cross old
relation; what must it be when she is denying herself, not only
her pleasure, but her food for her sake; not merely sitting
quietly with her all day, and calling a servant to wait upon her,
but toiling all day to maintain her, and keeping awake half the
night to nurse her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those are realities, indeed,&rsquo; said Alethea;
&lsquo;our greatest efforts seem but child&rsquo;s play in
comparison.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias could hardly have helped being sobered by this
conversation if she had attended to it, but she had turned away
to repeat the story of Mrs. Walls to Jane, and then, fancying
that the others were still remarking upon it, she said in a
light, laughing tone, &lsquo;Well, so far I agree with you.&nbsp;
I know of a person who may well be called one of ourselves, who I
could quite fancy making such a speech.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom do you mean?&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux.&nbsp;
Alethea wished she did not know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No very distant relation,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not talk nonsense, Jane,&rsquo; said Claude,
gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No nonsense at all, Claude,&rsquo; cried Jane in her
very very pertest tone, &lsquo;it is exactly like Eleanor; I am
sure I can see her with her hands before her, saying in her prim
voice, &ldquo;I must turn my old black silk and trim it with
crape, for I have had a misfortune, and lost my
brother.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lilias,&rsquo; said Miss Weston, somewhat abruptly,
&lsquo;did you not wish to sing with me this evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And thus she kept Lilias from any further public mischief that
evening.</p>
<p>Claude, exceedingly vexed by what had passed, with great
injustice, laid the blame upon Miss Weston, and instead of
rendering her the honour which she really deserved for the tact
with which she had put an end to the embarrassment of all
parties, he fancied she was anxious to display her talents for
music, and thus only felt fretted by the sounds.</p>
<p>Mr. Weston and his daughter intended to walk home that
evening, as it was a beautiful moonlight night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, let us convoy you!&rsquo; exclaimed Lilias;
&lsquo;I do long to show Alethea a glow-worm.&nbsp; Will you
come, Claude?&nbsp; May we, papa?&nbsp; Feel how still and warm
it is.&nbsp; A perfect summer night, not a breath
stirring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mohun consented, and Lily almost hurried Alethea upstairs,
to put on her bonnet and shawl.&nbsp; When she came down she
found that the walking party had increased.&nbsp; Jane and
Reginald would both have been in despair to have missed such a
frolic; Maurice hoped to fall in with the droning beetle, or to
lay violent hands on a glow-worm; Emily did not like to be left
behind, and even Mr. Mohun was going, being in the midst of an
interesting conversation with Mr. Weston.&nbsp; Lily, with an
absurd tragic gesture, told Alethea that amongst so many, such a
crowd, all the grace and sweet influence of the walk was
ruined.&nbsp; The &lsquo;sweet influence&rsquo; was ruined as far
as Lily was concerned, but not by the number of her
companions.&nbsp; It was the uneasy feeling caused by her
over-strained spirits and foolish chattering that prevented her
from really entering into the charm of the soft air, the clear
moon, the solemn deep blue sky, the few stars, the white lilies
on the dark pond, the long shadows of the trees, the freshness of
the dewy fields.&nbsp; Her simplicity, and her genuine delight in
the loveliness of the scene, was gone for the time, and though
she spoke much of her enjoyment, it was in a high-flown affected
style.</p>
<p>When the last good-night had been exchanged, and Lily had
turned homeward, she felt the stillness which succeeded their
farewells almost oppressive; she started at the dark shadow of a
tree which lay across the path, and to shake off a sensation of
fear which was coming over her, she put her arm within
Claude&rsquo;s, exclaiming, &lsquo;You naughty boy, you will be
stupid and silent, say what I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard enough to-night to strike me dumb,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>For one moment Lily thought he was in jest, but the gravity of
his manner showed her that he was both grieved and displeased,
and she changed her tone as she said, &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Claude,
what do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you not know?&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, you mean about Eleanor?&rsquo; said Lily;
&lsquo;you must fall upon Miss Jenny there&mdash;it was her
doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane&rsquo;s tongue is a pest,&rsquo; said Claude;
&lsquo;but she was not the first to speak evil falsely of one to
whom you owe everything.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Lily, I cannot tell you
how that allusion of yours sounded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What allusion?&rsquo; asked Lily in alarm, for she had
never seen her gentle brother so angry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I do not,&rsquo; exclaimed Lily, munch
frightened.&nbsp; &lsquo;Claude, Claude, you must mistake, I
never could have said anything so very shocking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I do,&rsquo; said Claude; &lsquo;I could hardly
believe that one of the little ones who cannot remember him,
could have referred to him in that way&mdash;but for
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Him?&rsquo; said Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not like to mention his name to one who regards
him so lightly,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Think over what
passed, if you are sufficiently come to yourself to remember
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a little pause Lily said in a subdued voice,
&lsquo;Claude, I hope you do not believe that I was thinking of
what really happened when I said that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray what were you thinking of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The abstract view of Eleanor&rsquo;s
character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abstract nonsense!&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
fine demonstration of the rule of love, to go about the world
slandering your sister!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To go about the world!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Claude, it was
only Robert, one of ourselves, and Alethea, to whom I tell
everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much the worse.&nbsp; I always rejoiced that you had
no foolish young lady friend to make missish confidences
to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is no foolish young lady friend,&rsquo; said
Lilias, indignant in her turn; &lsquo;she is five years older
than I am, and papa wishes us to be intimate with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the fault is in yourself,&rsquo; said
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;You ought not to have told such things if
they were true, and being utterly false&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Claude, I cannot see that they are
false.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not false, that Eleanor cared not a farthing for
Harry!&rsquo; cried Claude, shaking off Lily&rsquo;s arm, and
stopping short.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&mdash;she cared, she really did care,&rsquo; said
Lily, as fast as she could speak.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Claude,
how could you think that?&nbsp; I told you I did not mean what
really happened, only that&mdash;Eleanor is cold&mdash;not as
warm as some people&mdash;she did care for him, of course she
did&mdash;I know that&mdash;I believe she loved him with all her
heart&mdash;but yet&mdash;I mean she did not&mdash;she went on as
usual&mdash;said nothing&mdash;scarcely cried&mdash;looked the
same&mdash;taught us&mdash;never&mdash;Oh! it did not make half
the difference in her that it did in William.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell how she behaved at the time,&rsquo; said
Claude, &lsquo;I only know I never had any idea what a loss Harry
was till I came home and saw her face.&nbsp; I used never to
trouble myself to think whether people looked ill or well, but
the change in her did strike me.&nbsp; She was bearing up to
comfort papa, and to cheer William, and to do her duty by all of
us, and you could take such noble resignation for want of
feeling!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias looked down and tried to speak, but she was choked by
her tears; she could not bear Claude&rsquo;s displeasure, and she
wept in silence.&nbsp; At last she said in a voice broken by
sobs, &lsquo;I was unjust&mdash;I know Eleanor was all
kindness&mdash;all self-sacrifice&mdash;I have been very
ungrateful&mdash;I wish I could help it&mdash;and you know well,
Claude, how far I am from regarding dear Harry with
indifference&mdash;how the thought of him is a star in my
mind&mdash;how happy it makes me to think of him at the end of
the Church Militant Prayer; do not believe I was dreaming of
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pray,&rsquo; said Claude, laughing in his own
good-humoured way, &lsquo;which of us is it that she is so
willing to lose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Claude, no such thing,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;you
know what I meant, or did not mean.&nbsp; It was nonsense&mdash;I
hope nothing worse.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lily felt that she might take
his arm again.&nbsp; There was a little silence, and then Lily
resumed in a timid voice, &lsquo;I do not know whether you will
be angry, Claude, but honestly, I do not think that if&mdash;that
Eleanor would be so wretched about you as I should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eleanor knew Harry better than you did; no, Lily, I
never could have been what Harry was, even if I had never wasted
my time, and if my headaches had not interfered with my best
efforts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not believe that, say what you will,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ask William, then,&rsquo; said Claude, sighing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure papa does not think so,&rsquo; said Lily;
&lsquo;no, I cannot feel that Harry is such a loss when we still
have you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Lily, it is plain that you never knew Harry,&rsquo;
said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not believe you ever
did&mdash;that is one ting to be said for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not as you did,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;remember, he
was six years older.&nbsp; Then think how little we saw of him
whilst they were abroad; he was always at school, or spending the
holidays with Aunt Robert, and latterly even farther off, and
only coming sometimes for an hour or two to see us.&nbsp; Then he
used to kiss us all round, we went into the garden with him,
looked at him, and were rather afraid of him; then he walked off
to Wat Greenwood, came back, wished us good-bye, and away he
went.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;but after they came
home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he was a tall youth, and we were silly
girls,&rsquo; said Lilias; &lsquo;he avoided Miss Middleton, and
we were always with her.&nbsp; He was good-natured, but he could
not get on with us; he did very well with the little ones, but we
were of the wrong age.&nbsp; He and William and Eleanor were one
faction, we were another, and you were between both&mdash;he was
too old, too sublime, too good, too grave for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too grave!&rsquo; said Claude; &lsquo;I never heard a
laugh so full of glee, except, perhaps,
Phyllis&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The last time he was at home,&rsquo; continued Lily,
&lsquo;we began to know him better; there was no Miss Middleton
in the way, and after you and William were gone, he used to walk
with us, and read to us.&nbsp; He read <i>Guy Mannering</i> to
us, and told us the story of Sir Maurice de Mohun; but the loss
was not the same to us as to you elder ones; and then sorrow was
almost lost in admiration, and in pleasure at the terms in which
every one spoke of him.&nbsp; Claude, I have no difficulty in not
wishing it otherwise; he is still my brother, and I would not
change the feeling which the thought of his death gives
me&mdash;no, not for himself in life and health.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; sighed Claude, &lsquo;you have no cause for
self-reproach&mdash;no reason to lament over &ldquo;wasted hours
and love misspent.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will always talk of your old indolence, as if it
was a great crime,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was my chief temptation,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As long as we know we are out of the path of duty it does
not make much difference whether we have turned to the right hand
or to the left.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it Harry&rsquo;s death that made you look upon it
in this light?&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew it well enough before,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;it was what he had often set before me.&nbsp; Indeed, till
I came home, and saw this place without him, I never really knew
what a loss he was.&nbsp; At Eton I did not miss him more than
when he went to Oxford, and I did not dwell on what he was to
papa, or what I ought to be; and even when I saw what home was
without him, I should have contented myself with miserable
excuses about my health, if it had not been for my confirmation;
then I awoke, I saw my duty, and the wretched way in which I had
been spending my time.&nbsp; Thoughts of Harry and of my father
came afterwards; I had not vigour enough for them
before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here they reached the house, and parted&mdash;Claude, ashamed
of having talked of himself for the first time in his life, and
Lily divided between shame at her own folly and pleasure at
Claude&rsquo;s having thus opened his mind.</p>
<p>Jane, who was most in fault, escaped censure.&nbsp; Her father
was ignorant of her improper speech.&nbsp; Emily forgot it, and
it was not Claude&rsquo;s place to reprove his sisters, though to
Lily he spoke as a friend.&nbsp; It passed away from her mind
like other idle words, which, however, could not but leave an
impression on those who heard her.</p>
<p>An unlooked-for result of the folly of this evening was, that
Claude was prevented from appreciating Miss Weston He could not
learn to like her, nor shake off an idea, that she was prying
into their family concerns; he thought her over-praised, and
would not even give just admiration to her singing, because he
had once fancied her eager to exhibit it.&nbsp; It was
unreasonable to dislike his sister&rsquo;s friend for his
sister&rsquo;s folly, but Claude&rsquo;s wisdom was not yet
arrived at its full growth, and he deserved credit for keeping
his opinion to himself.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Bent brow and throbbing heart,<br />
Tries them with pain.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next week Lily had the pleasure
of fitting out Faith Longley for her place at Mrs.
Weston&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She rejoiced at this opportunity of
patronising her, because in her secret soul she felt that she
might have done her a little injustice in choosing her own
favourite Esther in her stead.&nbsp; Esther&rsquo;s popularity at
the New Court, however, made Lilias confident in her own
judgment; the servants liked her because she was quick and
obliging, Mr. Mohun said she looked very neat, Phyllis liked her
because a mischance to her frock was not so brave an offence with
her as with Rachel, and Ada was growing very fond of her, because
she was in the habit of bestowing great admiration on her golden
curls as she arranged them, and both little girls were glad not
to be compelled to put away the playthings they took out.</p>
<p>Maurice and Reginald had agreed to defer their onslaught on
the wasps till Lord Rotherwood&rsquo;s arrival, and the war was
now limited to attacks on foraging parties.&nbsp; Reginald most
carefully marked every nest about the garden and farm, and, on
his cousin&rsquo;s arrival on Saturday evening, began eagerly to
give him a list of their localities.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood was as
ardent in the cause as even Reginald could desire, and would have
instantly set out with him to reconnoitre had not the evening
been rainy.</p>
<p>Then turning to Claude, he said, &lsquo;But I have not told
you what brought me here; I came to persuade you to make an
expedition with me up the Rhine; I set off next week; I would not
write about it, because I knew you would only say you should like
it very much, but&mdash;some but, that meant it was a great deal
too much trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How fast the plan has risen up,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;I heard nothing of it when I was with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it only came into my head last week, but I do not
see what there is to wait for, second thoughts are never
best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Claude, how delightful,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>Claude stirred his tea meditatively, and did not speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is too much trouble, I perceive,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood; &lsquo;just as I told you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not exactly,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>Lord Rotherwood now detailed his plan to his uncle, who said
with a propitious smile, &lsquo;Well, Claude, what do you think
of it?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind you catch a firefly for me,&rsquo; said
Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you answer, Claude?&rsquo; said Lilias;
&lsquo;only imagine seeing Undine&rsquo;s Castle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh, Claude?&rsquo; said his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be very pleasant,&rsquo; said Claude, slowly,
&lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a but,&rsquo; said the Marquis.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
hope he will have disposed of it by the morning; I start next
Tuesday week; I would not go later for the universe; we shall be
just in time for the summer in its beauty, and to have a peep at
Switzerland.&nbsp; We shall not have time for Mont Blanc, without
rattling faster than any man in his senses would do.&nbsp; I do
not mean to leave any place till I have thoroughly seen twice
over everything worth seeing that it contains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then perhaps you will get as far as Antwerp, and spend
the rest of the holidays between the Cathedral and Paul
Potter&rsquo;s bull.&nbsp; No, I shall have nothing to say to you
at that rate,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Depend upon it, it will be you that will wish to stand
still when I had rather be on the move,&rsquo; said the
Marquis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you had better leave me behind.&nbsp; I have no
intention of being hurried over the world, and never having my
own way,&rsquo; said Claude, trying to look surly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I should not mind travelling twice over the
world to see Cologne Cathedral, or the field of Waterloo,&rsquo;
said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me only show him my route,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;Redgie, look in my greatcoat pocket in
the hall for Murray&rsquo;s Handbook, will you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go and get it, Phyl,&rsquo; said Reginald, who was
astride on the window-sill, peeling a stick.</p>
<p>Away darted Lord Rotherwood to fetch it himself, but Phyllis
was before him; her merry laugh was heard, as he chased her round
the hall to get possession of his book, throwing down two or
three cloaks to intercept her path.&nbsp; Mr. Mohun took the
opportunity of his absence to tell Claude that he need not refuse
on the score of expense.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; was all Claude&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>Lord Rotherwood returned, and after punishing the discourteous
Reginald by raising him up by his ears, he proceeded to give a
full description of the delights of his expedition, the girls
joining heartily with him in declaring it as well arranged as
possible, and bringing all their knowledge of German travels to
bear upon it.&nbsp; Claude sometimes put in a word, but never as
if he cared much about the matter, and he was not to be persuaded
to give any decided answer as to whether he would accompany the
Marquis.</p>
<p>The next morning at breakfast Lord Rotherwood returned to the
charge, but Claude seemed even more inclined to refuse than the
day before.&nbsp; Lilias could not divine what was the matter
with him, and lingered long after her sisters had gone to school,
to hear what answer he would make; and when Mr. Mohun looked at
his watch, and asked her if she knew how late it was, she rose
from the breakfast-table with a sigh, and thought while she was
putting on her bonnet how much less agreeable the school had been
since the schism in the parish.&nbsp; And besides, now that Faith
and Esther, and one or two others of her best scholars, had gone
away from school, there seemed to be no one of any intelligence
or knowledge left in the class, except Marianne Weston, who knew
too much for the others, and one or two clever inattentive little
girls: Lily almost disliked teaching them.</p>
<p>Phyllis and Adeline were in Miss Weston&rsquo;s class, and
much did they delight in her teaching.&nbsp; There was a quiet
earnestness in her manner which attracted her pupils, and fixed
their attention, so as scarcely to allow the careless room for
irreverence, while mere cleverness seemed almost to lose its
advantage in learning what can only truly be entered into by
those whose conduct agrees with their knowledge.</p>
<p>Phyllis never dreamt that she could be happy while standing
still and learning, till Miss Weston began to teach at the Sunday
school.&nbsp; Obedience at school taught her to acquire habits of
reverent attention, which gradually conquered the idleness and
weariness which had once possessed her at church.&nbsp; First,
she learnt to be interested in the Historical Lessons, then never
to lose her place in the Psalms, then to think about and follow
some of the Prayers; by this time she was far from feeling any
fatigue at all on week-days; she had succeeded in restraining any
contortions to relieve herself from the irksomeness of sitting
still, and had her thoughts in tolerable order through the
greater part of the Sunday service, and now it was her great
wish, unknown to any one, to abstain from a single yawn through
the whole service, including the sermon!</p>
<p>Her place (chosen for her by Eleanor when first she had begun
to go to Church, as far as possible from Reginald) was at the end
of the seat, between her papa and the wall.&nbsp; This morning,
as she put her arm on the book-board, while rising from kneeling,
she felt a sudden thrill of sharp pain smear her left elbow,
which made her start violently, and would have caused a scream,
had she not been in church.&nbsp; She saw a wasp fall on the
ground, and was just about to put her foot on it, when she
recollected where she was.&nbsp; She had never in her life
intentionally killed anything, and this was no time to begin in
that place, and when she was angry.&nbsp; The pain was
severe&mdash;more so perhaps than any she had felt
before&mdash;and very much frightened, she pulled her
papa&rsquo;s coat to draw his attention.&nbsp; But her first pull
was so slight that he did not feel it, and before she gave a
second she remembered that she could not make him hear what was
the matter, without more noise than was proper.&nbsp; No, she
must stay where she was, and try to bear the pain, and she knew
that if she did try, help would be given her.&nbsp; She proceeded
to find out the Psalm and join her voice with the others, though
her heart was beating very fast, her forehead was contracted, and
she could not help keeping her right hand clasped round her arm,
and sometimes shifting from one foot to the other.&nbsp; The
sharpness of the pain soon went off; she was able to attend to
the Lessons, and hoped it would soon be quite well; but as soon
as she began to think about it, it began to ache and throb, and
seemed each moment to be growing hotter.&nbsp; The sermon
especially tried her patience, her cheeks were burning, she felt
sick and hardly able to hold up her head, yet she would not lean
it against the wall, because she had often been told not to do
so.&nbsp; She was exceedingly alarmed to find that her arm had
swelled so much that she could hardly bend it, and it had
received the impression of the gathers of her sleeve; she thought
no sermon had ever been so long, but she sat quite still and
upright, as she could not have done, had she not trained herself
unconsciously by her efforts to leave off the trick of kicking
her heels together.&nbsp; She did not speak till she was in the
churchyard, and then she made Emily look at her arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor child, it is frightful,&rsquo; said Emily,
&lsquo;what is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wasp stung me just before the Psalms,&rsquo; said
Phyllis, &lsquo;and it goes on swelling and swelling, and it does
pant!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa, just look,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;a wasp stung
this dear child quite early in the service, and she has been
bearing it all this time in silence.&nbsp; Why did you not show
me, Phyl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because it was in church,&rsquo; said the little
girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Phyllis, you are a very Spartan,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something better than a Spartan,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.&nbsp; &lsquo;Does it give you much pain now, my
dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so bad as in church,&rsquo; said Phyllis,
&lsquo;only I am very tired, and it is so hot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will help you home, then,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.&nbsp; As he took her up in his arms, Phyllis laughed,
thanked him, replied to various inquiries from her sisters and
the Westons&mdash;laughed again at sundry jokes from her
brothers, then became silent, and was almost asleep, with her
head on her papa&rsquo;s shoulder, by the time they reached the
hall-door.&nbsp; She thought it very strange to be laid down on
the sofa in the drawing-room, and to find every one attending to
her.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston bathed her forehead with lavender-water,
and Lily cut open the sleeve of her frock; Jane fetched all
manner of remedies, and Emily pitied her.&nbsp; She was rather
frightened: she thought such a fuss would not be made about her
unless she was very ill; she was faint and tired, and was glad
when Mrs. Weston proposed that they should all come away, and
leave her to go to sleep quietly.</p>
<p>Marianne was so absorbed in admiration of Phyllis that she did
not speak one word all the way from church to the New Court, and
stood in silence watching the operations upon her friend, till
Mrs. Weston sent every one away.</p>
<p>Adeline rather envied Phyllis; she would willingly have
endured the pain to be made of so much importance, and said to be
better than a Spartan, which must doubtless be something very
fine indeed!</p>
<p>Phyllis was waked by the bells ringing for the afternoon
service; Mrs. Weston was sitting by her, reading, Claude came to
inquire for her, and to tell her that as she had lost her early
dinner, she was to join the rest of the party at six.&nbsp; To
her great surprise she felt quite well and fresh, and her arm was
much better; Mrs. Weston pinned up her sleeve, and she set off
with her to church, wondering whether Ada would remember to tell
her what she had missed that afternoon at school.&nbsp; Those
whose approbation was valuable, honoured Phyllis for her conduct,
but she did not perceive it, or seek for it; she did not look
like a heroine while running about and playing with Reginald and
the dogs in the evening, but her papa had told her she was a good
child, Claude had given her one of his kindest smiles, and she
was happy.&nbsp; Even when Esther was looking at the mark left by
the sting, and telling her that she was sure Miss Marianne Weston
would have not been half so good, her simple, humble spirit came
to her aid, and she answered, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,
Esther, Marianne would have behaved much better, for she is
older, and never fidgets, and she would not have been angry like
me, and just going to kill the wasp.&rsquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">COUSIN ROTHERWOOD</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;We care
not who says<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And intends it dispraise,<br />
That an Angler to a fool is next neighbour.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the evening Lord Rotherwood
renewed his entreaties to Claude to join him on his
travels.&nbsp; He was very much bent on taking him, for his own
pleasure depended not a little on his cousin&rsquo;s
company.&nbsp; Claude lay on the glassy slope of the terrace,
while Lord Rotherwood paced rapidly up and down before him,
persuading him with all the allurements he could think of, and
looking the picture of impatience.&nbsp; Lily sat by, adding her
weight to all his arguments.&nbsp; But Claude was almost
contemptuous to all the beauties of Germany, and all the promised
sights; he scarcely gave himself the trouble to answer his
tormentors, only vouchsafing sometimes to open his lips to say
that he never meant to go to a country where people spoke a
language that sounded like cracking walnuts; that he hated
steamers; had no fancy for tumble-down castles; that it was so
common to travel; there was more distinction in staying at home;
that the field of Waterloo had been spoilt, and was not worth
seeing; his ideas of glaciers would be ruined by the reality; and
he did not care to see Cologne Cathedral till it was
finished.</p>
<p>On this Lily set up an outcry of horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One comfort is, Lily,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood,
&lsquo;he does not mean it; he did not say it from the bottom of
his heart.&nbsp; Now, confess you did not, Claude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude pretended to be asleep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see plainly enough,&rsquo; said the Marquis to Lily,
&lsquo;it is as Wat Greenwood says, &ldquo;Mr. Reynold and the
grapes.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is not,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;and that is
what provokes me; papa says he is quite welcome to go if he
likes, and that he thinks it will do him a great deal of good,
but that foolish boy will say nothing but &ldquo;I will think
about it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I give him up as regularly dense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the most delightful plan ever thought of,&rsquo;
said Lily, &lsquo;so easily done, and just bringing within his
compass all he ever wished to see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! his sole ambition is to stretch those long legs of
his on the grass, like a great vegetable marrow,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is vegetating like a plant that makes
him so much taller than any rational creature with a little
animal life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think Jane has his share of curiosity,&rsquo; said
Lily, &lsquo;I am sure I had no idea that anything belonging to
us could be so stupid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Marquis, &lsquo;I shall not
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No?&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I shall certainly not go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Claude, waking from his pretended
sleep, &lsquo;why do you not ask Travers to go with you?&nbsp; He
would like nothing better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a botanist, and would bore me with looking for
weeds.&nbsp; No, I will have you, or stay at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude proposed several others as companions, but Lord
Rotherwood treated them all with as much disdain as Claude had
shown for Germany, and ended with &lsquo;Now, Claude, you know my
determination, only tell me why you will not go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I do tell you, Rotherwood, the truth is, that
those boys, Maurice and Reginald, are perfectly unmanageable when
they are left alone with the girls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have a tutor for them,&rsquo; said the Marquis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very much obliged to you they would be for the
suggestion,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! but Claude,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really cannot go.&nbsp; They mind no one but the
Baron and me, and besides that, it would be no small annoyance to
the house; ten tutors could not keep them from indescribable bits
of mischief.&nbsp; I undertook them these holidays, and I mean to
keep them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias was just flying off to her father, when Claude caught
hold of her, saying, &lsquo;I desire you will not,&rsquo; and she
stood still, looking at her cousin in dismay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all right,&rsquo; cried the Marquis, joyfully,
&lsquo;it is only to set off three weeks later.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I thought you would not go a week later for the
universe,&rsquo; said Claude, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not for the Universe, but for U&mdash;,&rsquo; said
Lord Rotherwood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worthy of a companion true, of the University of
Gottingen,&rsquo; said Claude; &lsquo;but, Rotherwood, do you
really mean that it will make no difference to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None whatever; I meant to spend three weeks with my
mother at the end of the tour, and I shall spend them now
instead.&nbsp; I only talked of going immediately, because
nothing is done at all that is not done quickly, and I hate
delays, but it is all the same, and now it stands for Tuesday
three weeks.&nbsp; Now we shall see what he says to Cologne,
Lily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude sprung up, and began talking over arrangements and
possibilities with zest, which showed what his wishes had been
from the first.&nbsp; All was quickly settled, and as soon as his
father had given his cordial approbation to the scheme, it was
amusing to see how animated and active Claude became, and in how
different a style he talked of the once slighted Rhine.</p>
<p>Lord Rotherwood told the boys that their brother was a great
deal too good for them, but they never troubled themselves to ask
in what respect; Lilias took very great delight in telling Emily
of the sacrifice which he had been willing to make, and looked
forward to talking it over with Alethea, but she refrained, as
long as he was at home, as she knew it would greatly displease
him, and she had heard enough about missish confidences.</p>
<p>The Marquis of Rotherwood was certainly the very reverse of
his chosen travelling companion, in the matter of activity.&nbsp;
He made an appointment with the two boys to get up at half-past
four on Monday morning for some fishing, before the sun was too
high&mdash;Maurice not caring for the sport, but intending to
make prize of any of the &lsquo;insect youth&rsquo; which might
prefer the sunrise for their gambols; and Reginald, in high
delight at the prospect of real fishing, something beyond his own
performances with a stick and a string, in pursuit of minnows in
the ditches.&nbsp; Reginald was making contrivances for tying a
string round his wrist and hanging the end of it from the window,
that Andrew Grey might give it a pull as he went by to his work,
to wake him, when Lord Rotherwood exclaimed, &lsquo;What! cannot
you wake yourself at any time you please?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Reginald, &lsquo;I never heard of any
one that could.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I advise you to learn the art; in the meantime I
will call you to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Loud voices and laughter in the hall, and the front door
creaking on its hinges at sunrise, convinced the household that
this was no vain boast; before breakfast was quite over the
fishermen were seen approaching the house.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood
was an extraordinary figure, in an old shooting jacket of his
uncle&rsquo;s, an enormous pair of fishing-boots of
William&rsquo;s, and the broad-brimmed straw hat, which always
hung up in the hall, and was not claimed by any particular
owner.</p>
<p>Maurice displayed to Jane the contents of two phials, strange
little creatures, with stranger names, of which he was as proud
as Reginald of his three fine trout.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood did
not appear till he had made himself look like other people, which
he did in a surprisingly short time.&nbsp; He began estimating
the weight of the fish, and talking at his most rapid rate, till
at last Claude said, &lsquo;Phyllis told us just now that you
were coming back, for that she heard Cousin Rotherwood talking,
and it proved to be Jane&rsquo;s old turkey cock
gobbling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No bad compliment,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;for
Phyllis was once known to say, on hearing a turkey cock,
&ldquo;How melodiously that nightingale sings.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no! that was Ada,&rsquo; said Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could answer for that,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Phyllis is too familiar with both parties to mistake their
notes.&nbsp; Besides, she never was known to use such a word as
melodiously.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you remember,&rsquo; said the Marquis, &lsquo;that
there was some great lawyer who had three kinds of handwriting,
one that the public could read, one that only his clerk could
read, and one that nobody could read?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I am the clerk,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;unless I divide the honour with Florence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think I am unintelligible anywhere but
here,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is nothing
sufficiently exciting at home, if Grosvenor Square is to be
called home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sometimes you do it without knowing it,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;when you do not exactly
know what you are going to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is no bad plan,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;People are satisfied, and you
don&rsquo;t commit yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Cousin Rotherwood,&rsquo;
exclaimed Phyllis, &lsquo;your hand is bleeding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it?&nbsp; Thank you, Phyllis, I thought I had washed
it off: now do find me some sealing-wax&mdash;India-rub
her&mdash;sticking-plaster, I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Rotherwood,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;what a
bad cut, how did it happen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only, I am the victim to Maurice&rsquo;s first essay in
fishing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just fancy what an awkward fellow Maurice is,&rsquo;
said Reginald, &lsquo;he had but one throw, and he managed to
stick the hook into Rotherwood&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of those barbed hooks?&nbsp; Oh! Rotherwood, how
horrid!&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he cut it out with his knife, and caught that great
trout with it directly,&rsquo; said Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And neither half drowned Maurice, nor sent him home
again?&rsquo; asked Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I contented myself with taking away his weapon,&rsquo;
said the Marquis; &lsquo;and he wished for nothing better than to
poke about in the gutters for insects; it was only Redgie that
teased him into the nobler sport.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emily was inclined to make a serious matter of the accident,
but her cousin said ten words while she said one, and by the time
her first sentence was uttered, she found him talking about his
ride to Devereux Castle.</p>
<p>He and Claude set out as soon as breakfast was over, and came
back about three o&rsquo;clock; Claude was tired with the heat,
and betook himself to the sofa, where he fell asleep, under
pretence of reading, but the indefatigable Marquis was ready and
willing to set out with Reginald and Wat Greenwood to shoot
rabbits.</p>
<p>Dinner-time came, and Emily sat at the drawing-room window
with Claude and Lilias, lamenting her cousin&rsquo;s bad
habits.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing will ever make him punctual,&rsquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am in duty bound to let you say nothing against
him,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very good-natured in him to wait for you,&rsquo;
said Lily, &lsquo;but it would be horribly selfish to leave you
behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delay is his great horror,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;and the wonder of his character is, that he is not
selfish.&nbsp; No one had ever better training for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He does like his own way very much,&rsquo; said
Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who does not?&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing shows his sense so much,&rsquo; said Emily,
&lsquo;as his great attachment to papa&mdash;the only person who
ever controlled him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to Claude&mdash;his opposite in everything,&rsquo;
said Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he will tire you to death in Germany,&rsquo;
said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;my <i>vis
inerti&aelig;</i> is enough to counterbalance any amount of
restlessness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here they come,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;how Wat
Greenwood is grinning at Rotherwood&rsquo;s jokes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A happy day for Wat,&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
will be quite dejected if William is not at home next shooting
season.&nbsp; He thinks you a degenerate Mohun,
Claude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He must comfort himself with Redgie,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rotherwood is only eager about shooting in common with
everything else,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;but Redgie, I fear,
will care for nothing else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Rotherwood came in, accounting for being late, as, in
passing through a harvest field, he could not help attempting to
reap.&nbsp; The Beechcroft farming operations had been his
especial amusement from very early days, and his plans were
numerous for farming on a grand scale as soon as he should be of
age.&nbsp; His talk during dinner was of turnips and wheat, till
at length Mr. Mohun asked him what he thought of the appearance
of the castle.&nbsp; He said it was very forlorn; the rooms
looked so dreary and deserted that he could not bear to be in
them, and had been out of doors almost all the time.&nbsp;
Indeed, he was afraid he had disappointed the housekeeper by not
complimenting her as she deserved, for the freezing dismal order
in which she kept everything.&nbsp; &lsquo;And really,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;I must go again to-morrow and make up for it, and
Emily, you must come with me and try to devise something to make
the unhappy place less like the abode of the Prince of the Black
Islands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emily willingly promised to go, and she went on talking to
him, and telling him whom he was to meet on the next day, when an
unusual silence making her look up, she beheld him more than half
asleep.</p>
<p>Reginald fidgeted and sighed, and Maurice grew graver and
graver as they thought of the wasps.&nbsp; Maurice wanted to take
a nest entire, and began explaining his plan to Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, Claude, burning some straw and then digging,
spoils the combs, as Wat does it; now I have got some puff-balls
and sulphur to put into the hole, and set fire to them with a
lucifer match, so as to stifle the wasps, and then dig them out
quietly to-morrow morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all of no use, if that Rotherwood will do nothing
but sleep,&rsquo; said Reginald, in a disconsolate tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not have made him get up at four,&rsquo;
said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who!&nbsp; I?&rsquo; exclaimed the Marquis.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I never was wider awake.&nbsp; What are you waiting for,
Reginald?&nbsp; I thought you were going to take wasps&rsquo;
nests.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are much too tired, I am sure,&rsquo; said
Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tired! not in the least, I have done nothing to-day to
tire me,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood, walking up and down the
room to keep himself awake.</p>
<p>The whole party went out, and found Wat Greenwood waiting for
them with a bundle of straw, a spade, and a little
gunpowder.&nbsp; Maurice carried a basket containing all his
preparations, on which Wat looked with supreme contempt, telling
him that his puffs were too green to make a smeech.&nbsp;
Maurice, not condescending to argue the point, ran on to a nest
which Reginald had marked on one of the green banks of the
ancient moat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care that the wasps are all come in; mind what you
are about, Maurice,&rsquo; called his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Master Maurice,&rsquo; shouted Wat, &lsquo;you had
better take a green bough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, Wat,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood, &lsquo;he
would not stay long enough to use it if he had it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reginald ran after Maurice, who had just reached the nest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is one coming in, the evening is so warm they are
not quiet yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll quiet them,&rsquo; said Maurice, kneeling
down, and putting his first puff-ball into the hole.</p>
<p>Reginald stood by with a sly smile, as he pulled a branch off
a neighbouring filbert-tree.&nbsp; The next moment Maurice gave a
sudden yell, &lsquo;The wasps! the wasps!&rsquo; and jumping up,
and tripping at his first step, rolled down the bank, and landed
safely at Lord Rotherwood&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; The shouts of
laughter were loud, but he regarded them not, and as soon as he
recovered his feet, rushed past his sisters, and never stopped
till he reached the house.&nbsp; Redgie stood alone, in the midst
of a cloud of wasps, beating them off with a bough, roaring with
laughter, and calling Wat to bring the straw to burn them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Redgie, come away, leave them for Maurice to
try again,&rsquo; said his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The brute, he stung me,&rsquo; cried Reginald, knocking
down a wasp or two as he came down.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is
this?&rsquo; added he, as he stumbled over something at the
bottom of the slope.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Maurice&rsquo;s
basket; look here&mdash;laudanum&mdash;did he mean to poison the
wasps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;to cure their
stings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The poor unhappy quiz!&rsquo; cried Reginald.</p>
<p>While the others were busy over a nest, Mr. Mohun asked Emily
how the boy got at the medicine chest.&nbsp; Emily looked
confused, and said she supposed Jane had given him a bottle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane is too young to be trusted there,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun, &lsquo;I thought you knew better; do not let the key be
out of your possession again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a few more nests had been taken in the usual manner,
they returned to the house.&nbsp; Maurice was lying on the sofa
reading the <i>Penny Magazine</i>, from which he raised his eyes
no more that evening, in spite of all the jokes which flew about
respecting wounded knights, courage, and the balsam of
Fierabras.&nbsp; He called Jane to teach her how flies were made,
and as soon as tea was over he went to bed.&nbsp; Reginald, after
many yawns, prepared to follow his example, and as he was wishing
his sisters good-night, Emily said, &lsquo;Now, Redgie, do not go
out at such a preposterous hour to-morrow morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that to you?&rsquo; was Reginald&rsquo;s
courteous inquiry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not wish to see every one fast asleep to-morrow
evening,&rsquo; said Emily, and she looked at her cousin, whose
head was far back over his chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a Trojan,&rsquo; said Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is a Trojan better than a Spartan?&rsquo; asked Ada,
meditatively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Helen thought so,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of
war,&rdquo;&rsquo; muttered the Marquis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are all talking Greek,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arabic,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>As far as it could be comprehended, Lord Rotherwood&rsquo;s
answer related to Maurice and the wasps.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;what is to be done if
he is in that condition to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not asleep; what makes you think I am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would sit in that great chair,&rsquo; said
Emily, &lsquo;I am afraid you will break your neck; you look so
uncomfortable, I cannot bear to see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never was more comfortable in my life,&rsquo; said
Lord Rotherwood, asleep while finishing the sentence; but this
time, happily with his elbows on the table, and his head in a
safer position.</p>
<p>The next day was spent rather more rationally.&nbsp; Lord
Rotherwood met with a book of Irish Tales, with which he became
so engrossed that he did not like to leave it when Emily and
Claude were ready to ride to Devereux Castle with him.&nbsp; When
there he was equally eager and vehement about each matter that
came under consideration, and so many presented themselves, that
Emily began to be in agonies lest she should not be at home in
time to dress and receive her guests.&nbsp; They did, however,
reach the house before Lilias, who had been walking with Miss
Weston, came in, and when she went upstairs, she found Emily full
of complaints at the inconvenience of having no Rachel to assist
her in dressing, and to see that everything was in order, and
that Phyllis was fit to appear when she came down in the evening;
but, by the assistance of Lily and Jane, she got over her
troubles, and when she went into the drawing-room, she was much
relieved to find her two gentlemen quite safe and dressed.&nbsp;
She had been in great fear of Lord Rotherwood&rsquo;s straying
away to join in some of Reginald&rsquo;s sports, and was grateful
to the Irish book for keeping him out of mischief.</p>
<p>Emily was in her glory; it was the first large dinner-party
since Eleanor had gone, and though she pitied herself for having
the trouble of entertaining the people, she really enjoyed the
feeling that she now appeared as the mistress of New Court, with
her cousin, the Marquis, by her side, to show how highly she was
connected.&nbsp; And everything went off just as could be
wished.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood talked intelligibly and sensibly,
and Mr. Mohun&rsquo;s neighbour at dinner had a voice which he
could hear.&nbsp; Lily&rsquo;s pleasure was not less than her
sister&rsquo;s, though of a different kind.&nbsp; She delighted
in thinking how well Emily did the honours, in watching the
varied expression of Lord Rotherwood&rsquo;s animated
countenance, in imagining Claude&rsquo;s forehead to be finer
than that of any one else, and in thinking how people must admire
Reginald&rsquo;s tall, active figure, and very handsome
face.&nbsp; She was asked to play, and did tolerably well, but
was too shy to sing, nor, indeed, was Reginald encouraging.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What is the use of your singing, Lily?&nbsp; If it was
like Miss Weston&rsquo;s, now&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reginald had taken a great fancy to Miss Weston; he stood by
her all the evening, and afterwards let her talk to him, and then
began to chatter himself, at last becoming so confidential as to
impart to her the grand object of his ambition, which was to be
taller than Claude!</p>
<p>The next morning Lord Rotherwood left Beechcroft, somewhat to
Emily&rsquo;s relief; for though she was very proud of him, and
much enjoyed the dignity of being seen to talk familiarly with
him, yet, when no strangers were present, and he became no more
than an ordinary cousin, she was worried by his incessant
activity, and desire to see, know, and do everything as fast and
as thoroughly as possible.&nbsp; She could not see the use of
such vehemence; she liked to take things in a moderate way, and
as Claude said, much preferred the passive to the active
voice.&nbsp; Claude, on the contrary, was ashamed of his
constitutional indolence, looked on it as a temptation, and
struggled against it, almost envying his cousin his unabated
eagerness and untiring energy, and liking to be with him, because
no one else so effectually roused him from his habitual
languor.&nbsp; His indolence was, however, so much the effect of
ill health, that exertion was sometimes scarcely in his power,
especially in hot weather, and by the time his brothers&rsquo;
studies were finished each day, he was unfit for anything but to
lie on the grass under the plane-tree.</p>
<p>The days glided on, and the holidays came to an end; Maurice
spent them in adding to his collection of insects, which, with
Jane&rsquo;s assistance, he arranged very neatly; and Reginald
and Phyllis performed several exploits, more agreeable to
themselves than satisfactory to the more rational part of the New
Court community.&nbsp; At the same time, Reginald&rsquo;s
devotion to Miss Weston increased; he never moved from her side
when she sang, did not fail to be of the party when she walked
with his sisters, offered her one of his own puppies, named his
little ship &lsquo;Alethea,&rsquo; and was even tolerably civil
to Marianne.</p>
<p>At length the day of departure came; the boys returned to
school, Claude joined Lord Rotherwood, and the New Court was
again in a state of tranquillity.</p>

123</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DANCING</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Prescribe us not
our duties.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Phyllis,&rsquo; said
her father, as he passed through the hall to mount his horse,
&lsquo;how do you like the prospect of Monsieur le Roi&rsquo;s
instructions?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all, papa,&rsquo; answered Phyllis, running out
to the hall door to pat the horse, and give it a piece of
bread.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care you turn out your toes,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must learn to dance like a dragon before
Cousin Rotherwood&rsquo;s birthday next year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa, how do dragons dance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a question I must decide at my leisure,&rsquo;
said Mr. Mohun, mounting.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stand out of the way,
Phyl, or you will feel how horses dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Away he rode, while Phyllis turned with unwilling steps to the
nursery, to be dressed for her first dancing lesson; Marianne
Weston was to learn with her, and this was some consolation, but
Phyllis could not share in the satisfaction Adeline felt in the
arrival of Monsieur le Roi.&nbsp; Jane was also a pupil, but
Lily, whose recollections of her own dancing days were not
agreeable, absented herself entirely from the dancing-room, even
though Alethea Weston had come with her sister.</p>
<p>Poor Phyllis danced as awkwardly as was expected, but Adeline
seemed likely to be a pupil in whom a master might rejoice;
Marianne was very attentive and not ungraceful, but Alethea soon
saw reason to regret the arrangement that had been made, for she
perceived that Jane considered the master a fair subject for
derision, and her &lsquo;nods and becks, and wreathed
smiles,&rsquo; called up corresponding looks in Marianne&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh Brownie, you are a naughty thing!&rsquo; said Emily,
as soon as M. le Roi had departed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He really was irresistible!&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose ridicule is one of the disagreeables to which
a dancing-master makes up his mind,&rsquo; said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;one can have no
compunction in quizzing that species.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think I can quite say that, Jane,&rsquo; said
Miss Weston.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This man especially lays himself open to
ridicule,&rsquo; said Jane; &lsquo;do you know, Alethea, that he
is an Englishman, and his name is King, only he calls himself Le
Roi, and speaks broken English!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Alethea joined in the general laugh, she did not feel
quite satisfied; she feared that if not checked in time, Jane
would proceed to actual impertinence, and that Marianne would be
tempted to follow her example, but she did not like to interfere,
and only advised Marianne to be on her guard, hoping that Emily
would also speak seriously to her sister.</p>
<p>On the next occasion, however, Jane ventured still farther;
her grimaces were almost irresistible, and she had a most comical
manner of imitating the master&rsquo;s attitudes when his eye was
not upon her, and putting on a demure countenance when he turned
towards her, which sorely tried Marianne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall I do, Alethea?&rsquo; said the little girl,
as the sisters walked home together; &lsquo;I do not know how to
help laughing, if Jane will be so very funny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid we must ask mamma to let us give up the
dancing,&rsquo; replied Alethea; &lsquo;the temptation is almost
too strong, and I do not think she would wish to expose you to
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Alethea, why do not you speak to Jane?&rsquo;
asked Marianne; &lsquo;no one seems to tell her it is wrong; Miss
Mohun was almost laughing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think Jane would consider that I ought to find
fault with her,&rsquo; said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you would not scold her,&rsquo; urged Marianne;
&lsquo;only put her in mind that it is not right, not kind; that
Monsieur le Roi is in authority over her for the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will speak to mamma,&rsquo; said Alethea,
&lsquo;perhaps it will be better next time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And it was better, for Mr. Mohun happening to be at home, was
dragged into the dancing-room by Emily and Ada.&nbsp; Once, when
she thought he was looking another way, Jane tried to raise a
smile, but a stern &lsquo;Jane, what are you thinking of?&rsquo;
recalled her to order, and when the lesson was over her father
spoke gravely to her, telling her that he thought few things more
disgusting in a young lady than impertinence towards her
teachers; and then added, &lsquo;Miss Weston, I hope you keep
strict watch over these giddy young things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Awed by her father, Jane behaved tolerably well at that time
and the next, and Miss Weston hoped her interference would not be
needed, but as if to make up for this restraint, her conduct a
fortnight after was quite beyond bearing.&nbsp; She used every
means to make Marianne laugh, and at last went so far as to
pretend to think that M. le Roi had not understood what she said
in English, and to translate it into French.&nbsp; Poor Marianne
looked imploringly at her sister, and Alethea hoped that Emily
would interpose, but Emily was turning away her head to conceal a
laugh, and Miss Weston was obliged to give Jane a very grave
look, which she perfectly understood, though she pretended not to
see it.&nbsp; When the exercise was over Miss Weston made her a
sign to approach, and said, &lsquo;Jane, do you think your papa
would have liked&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;I have not
been laughing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know what I mean,&rsquo; said Alethea, &lsquo;and
pray do not be displeased if I ask you not to make it difficult
for Marianne to behave properly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane drew up her head and went back to her place.&nbsp; She
played no more tricks that day, but as soon as the guests were
gone, began telling Lilias how Miss Weston had been meddling and
scolding her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And well you must have deserved it,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not say that Jenny was right,&rsquo; said Emily,
&lsquo;but I think Miss Weston might allow me to correct my own
sister in my own house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You correct Jane!&rsquo; cried Lily, and Jane
laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only mean,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;that it was not
very polite, and papa says the closest friendship is no reason
for dispensing with the rules of politeness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;the rules of
politeness are rules of love, and it was in love that Alethea
spoke; she sees how sadly we are left to ourselves, and is kind
enough to speak a word in season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;since it was in love
that she spoke, you would like to have her for our reprover for
ever, and I can assure you more unlikely things have
happened.&nbsp; I have heard it from one who can
judge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me hear no more of this,&rsquo; said Emily,
&lsquo;it is preposterous and ridiculous, and very disrespectful
to papa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane for once, rather shocked at her own words, went back to
what had been said just before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, perhaps, you would like to have Eleanor back
again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure you want some one to put you in mind of your
duty,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eleanor and duty!&rsquo; cried Emily; &lsquo;you who
thought so much of the power of love!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of Emily and love, she would say, if it sounded
well,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot see what true love you or Jane are showing
now,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;it is no kindness to encourage her
pertness, or to throw away a friendly reproof because it offends
your pride.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody reproved me,&rsquo; replied Emily;
&lsquo;besides, I know love will prevail; for my sake Jane will
not expose herself and me to a stranger&rsquo;s
interference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you depend upon that, I wish you joy,&rsquo; said
Lilias, as she left the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a weathercock Lily is!&rsquo; cried Jane,
&lsquo;she has fallen in love with Alethea Weston, and echoes all
she says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not considering her own inconsistency,&rsquo; said
Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Alethea Weston,&rsquo; exclaimed Jane, in an angry
tone;&mdash;but Emily, beginning to recover some sense of
propriety, said, &lsquo;Jenny, you know you were very ill-bred,
and you made it difficult for the little ones to behave
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not our own little ones,&rsquo; said Jane;
&lsquo;honest Phyl did not understand the joke, and Ada was
thinking of her attitudes; one comfort is, that I shall be
confirmed in three weeks&rsquo; time, and then people cannot
treat me as a mere child&mdash;little as I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Jane,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;I do not like
to hear you talk of confirmation in that light way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;I do not mean
it&mdash;of course I do not mean it&mdash;don&rsquo;t look
shocked&mdash;it was only by the bye&mdash;and another by the
bye, Emily, you know I must have a cap and white ribbons, and I
am afraid I must make it myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, that is the worst of having Esther,&rsquo; said
Emily, &lsquo;she and Hannah have no notion of anything but the
plainest work; I am sure if I had thought of all the trouble of
that kind which having a young girl would entail, I would never
have consented to Esther&rsquo;s coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was entirely Lily&rsquo;s scheme,&rsquo; said
Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; it is impossible to resist Lily, she is so eager
and anxious, and it would have vexed her very much if I had
opposed her, and that I cannot bear; besides, Esther is a very
nice girl, and will learn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is Robert talking to papa on the green,&rsquo;
said Jane; &lsquo;what a deep conference; what can it be
about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>If Jane had heard that conversation she might have perceived
that she could not wilfully offend, even in what she thought a
trifling matter, without making it evident, even to others, that
there was something very wrong about her.&nbsp; At that moment
the Rector was saying to his uncle, &lsquo;I am in doubt about
Jane, I cannot but fear she is not in a satisfactory state for
confirmation, and I wished to ask you what you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Act just as you would with any of the village
girls,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be very sorry to do otherwise,&rsquo; said Mr.
Devereux; &lsquo;but I thought you might like, since every one
knows that she is a candidate, that she should not be at home at
the time of the confirmation, if it is necessary to refuse
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;I should not wish to
shield her from the disgrace.&nbsp; It may be useful to her, and
besides, it will establish your character for impartiality.&nbsp;
I have not been satisfied with all I saw of little Jane for some
time past, and I am afraid that much passes amongst my poor girls
which never comes to my knowledge.&nbsp; Her pertness especially
is probably restrained in my presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not so much the pertness that I complain
of,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux, &lsquo;for that might be merely
exuberance of spirits, but there is a sort of habitual
irreverence, which makes one dread to bring her nearer to sacred
tings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what you mean,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;and
I think the pertness is a branch of it, more noticed because more
inconvenient to others.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux, &lsquo;I think the fault
I speak of is most evident; when there is occasion to reprove
her, I am always baffled by a kind of levity which makes every
warning glance aside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I should decidedly say refuse her,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be a warning that she could not
disregard, and the best chance of improving her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux, &lsquo;if she is eager
for confirmation, and regards it in its proper light, it is hard
to say whether it is right to deny it to her; it may give her the
depth and earnestness which she needs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor child,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;she has great
disadvantages; I am quite sure our present system is not fit for
her.&nbsp; Things shall be placed on a different footing, and in
another year or two I hope she may be fitter for
confirmation.&nbsp; However, before you finally decide, I should
wish to have some conversation with her, and speak to you
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is just what I wish,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux.</p>
<h2><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE FEVER</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Jane borrowed maxims from a doubting
school,<br />
And took for truth the test of ridicule.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> question of Jane&rsquo;s
confirmation was decided in an unexpected manner; for the day
after Mr. Mohun&rsquo;s conversation with his nephew she was
attacked by a headache and sore throat, spent a feverish night,
and in the morning was so unwell that a medical man was sent for
from Raynham.&nbsp; On his arrival he pronounced that she was
suffering from scarlet fever, and Emily began to feel the
approach of the same complaint.</p>
<p>Phyllis and Adeline were shut up in the drawing-room, and a
system of quarantine established, which was happily brought to a
conclusion by a note from Mrs. Weston, who kindly begged that
they might be sent to her at Broomhill, and Mr. Mohun gladly
availing himself of the offer, the little girls set off, so well
pleased to make a visit alone, as almost to forget the occasion
of it.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston had extended her invitation to Lilias,
but she begged to be allowed to remain with her sisters, and Mr.
Mohun thought that she had been already so much exposed to the
infection that it was useless for her to take any
precautions.</p>
<p>She was therefore declared head nurse; and it was well that
she had an energetic spirit, and so sweet a temper, that she was
ready to sympathise with all Emily&rsquo;s petulant complaints,
and even to find fault with herself for not being in two places
at once.&nbsp; Two of the maids were ill, and the whole care of
Emily and Jane devolved upon her, with only the assistance of
Esther.</p>
<p>Emily was not very seriously ill, but Jane&rsquo;s fever was
very high, and Lily thought that her father was more anxious than
he chose to appear.&nbsp; Of Jane&rsquo;s own thoughts little
could be guessed; she was often delirious, and at all times
speaking was so painful that she said as little as possible.</p>
<p>Lily&rsquo;s troubles seemed at their height one Sunday
afternoon, while her father was at church.&nbsp; She had been
reading the Psalms and Lessons to Emily, and she then rose to
return to Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not go,&rsquo; entreated Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will send Esther.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Esther is of no use.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And therefore I do not like to leave her so long alone
with Jane.&nbsp; Pray spare me a little smile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then come back soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily was glad to escape with no more objections.&nbsp; She
found Jane complaining of thirst, but to swallow gave her great
pain, and she required so much attendance for some little time,
that Emily&rsquo;s bell was twice rung before Esther could be
spared to go to her.</p>
<p>She soon came back, saying, &lsquo;Miss Mohun wants you
directly, Miss Lilias.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell her I will come presently,&rsquo; said Lily, who
had one hand pressed on Jane&rsquo;s burning temples, while the
other was sprinkling her with ether.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said Jane, faintly, and Esther left the
room.</p>
<p>Jane drew her breath with so much difficulty that a dreadful
terror seized upon Lily, lest she should be suffocated.&nbsp; She
raised her head, and supported her till Esther could bring more
pillows.&nbsp; Esther brought a message from Emily to hasten her
return; but Jane could not be left, and the grateful look she
gave her as she arranged the pillows repaid her for all her
toils.&nbsp; After a little time Jane became more comfortable,
and said in a whisper, &lsquo;Dear Lily, I wish I was not so
troublesome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Back came Esther at this moment, saying, &lsquo;Miss Emily
says she is worse, and wants you directly, Miss
Lilias.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily hurried away to Emily&rsquo;s room, and found what might
well have tried her temper.&nbsp; Emily was flushed indeed, and
feverish, but her breathing was smooth and even, and her hand and
pulse cool and slow, compared with the parched burning hands, and
throbbings, too quick to count, which Lily had just been
watching.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear Emily, I am sorry you do not feel better;
what can I do for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I be better while I am left so long, and Esther
not coming when I ring?&nbsp; What would happen if I were to
faint away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I am very sorry,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;but
when you rang, poor Jenny could spare neither of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is poor Jenny?&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her throat is very bad, but she is quite sensible now,
and wishes to have me there.&nbsp; What did you want,
Emily?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I wish you would draw the curtain, the light
hurts me; that will do&mdash;no&mdash;now it is worse, pray put
it as it was before.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Lily, if you knew how ill I
am you would not leave me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I do anything for you&mdash;will you have some
coffee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! no, it has a bad taste, I am sure it is carelessly
made.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I make you some fresh, with the spirit
lamp?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I am tired of it.&nbsp; I wonder if I might have
some tamarinds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will ask as soon as papa comes from
church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he gone to church? how could he go when we are all
so ill?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he was doing us more good at church than he
could at home.&nbsp; You will be glad to hear, Emily, that he has
sent for Rachel to come and help us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! has he? but she lives so far off, and gets her
letters so seldom, I don&rsquo;t reckon at all upon her
coming.&nbsp; If she could come directly it would be a
comfort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would, indeed,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;she would
know what to do for Jane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lily, where is the ether?&nbsp; You are always taking
it away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In Jane&rsquo;s room; I will fetch it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, if you once get into Jane&rsquo;s room I shall
never see you back again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now Emily knew that Jane was very ill, and Lily&rsquo;s pale
cheeks, heavy eyes, and failing voice, might have reminded her
that two sick persons were a heavy charge upon a girl of
seventeen, without the addition of her caprices and
fretfulness.&nbsp; And how was it that the kind-hearted,
affectionate Emily never thought of all this?&nbsp; It was
because she had been giving way to selfishness for nineteen
years; and now the contemplation of her own sufferings was quite
enough to hide from her that others had much to bear; and
illness, instead of teaching her patience and consideration, only
made her more exacting and querulous.</p>
<p>To Lily&rsquo;s unspeakable relief, Miss Weston accompanied
Mr. Mohun from church, and offered to share her attendance.&nbsp;
No one knew what it cost Alethea to come into the midst of a
scene which constantly reminded her of the sisters she had lost,
but she did not shrink from it, and was glad that her parents saw
no objection to her offering to share Lily&rsquo;s toils.&nbsp;
Her experience was most valuable, and relieved Lilias of the fear
that was continually haunting her, lest her ignorance might lead
to some fatal mistake.&nbsp; The next day brought Rachel, and
both patients began to mend.&nbsp; Jane&rsquo;s recovery was
quicker than Emily&rsquo;s, for her constitution was not so
languid, and having no pleasure in the importance of being an
invalid, she was willing to exert herself, and make the best of
everything, while Emily did not much like to be told that she was
better, and thought it cruel to hint that exertion would benefit
her.&nbsp; Both were convalescent before the fever attacked Lily,
who was severely ill, but not alarmingly so, and her gentleness
and patience made Alethea delight in having the care of
her.&nbsp; Lily was full of gratitude to her kind friend, and
felt quite happy when Alethea chanced one day to call her by the
name of Emma; she almost hoped she was taking the place of that
sister, and the thought cheered her through many languid hours,
and gave double value to all Alethea&rsquo;s kindness.&nbsp; She
did not feel disposed to repine at an illness which brought out
such affection from her friend, and still more from her father,
who, when he came to see her, would say things which gave her a
thrill of pleasure whenever she thought of them.</p>
<p>It happened one day that Jane, having finished her book,
looked round for some other occupation; she knew that Miss Weston
had walked to Broomhill; Rachael was with Lilias, and there was
no amusement at hand.&nbsp; At last she recollected that her papa
had said in the morning, that he hoped to see her and Emily in
the schoolroom in the course of the day, and hoping to meet her
sister, she resolved to try and get there.&nbsp; The room had
been Mr. Mohun&rsquo;s sitting-room since the beginning of their
illness, and it looked so very comfortable that she was glad she
had come, though she was so tired she wondered how she should get
back again.&nbsp; Emily was not there, so she lay down on the
sofa and took up a little book from the table.&nbsp; The title
was <i>Susan Harvey</i>, <i>or Confirmation</i>, and she read it
with more interest as she remembered with a pang that this was
the day of the confirmation, to which she had been invited; she
soon found herself shedding tears over the book, she who had
never yet been known to cry at any story, however
affecting.&nbsp; She had not finished when Mr. Devereux came in
to look for Mr. Mohun, and finding her there, was going away as
soon as he had congratulated her on having left her room, but she
begged him to stay, and began asking questions about the
confirmation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were there many people?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did the Stoney Bridge people make a
disturbance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many of our people?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty-seven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did all the girls wear caps?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane was rather surprised at the shortness of her
cousin&rsquo;s answers, but she went on, as he stood before the
fire, apparently in deep thought.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was Miss Burnet confirmed?&nbsp; She is the dullest
girl I ever knew, and she is older than I am.&nbsp; Was she
confused?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you give Mary Wright a ticket?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, of course, you did not give one to Ned
Long.&nbsp; I thought you would never succeed in making him
remember which is the ninth commandment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not refuse him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed! did he improve in a portentous
manner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not particularly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you must have been more merciful than I
expected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert, you must have lost the use of your tongue, for
want of us to talk to.&nbsp; I shall be affronted if you go into
a brown study the first day of seeing me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He smiled in a constrained manner, and after a few minutes
said, &lsquo;I have been considering whether this is a fit time
to tell you what will give you pain.&nbsp; You must tell me if
you can bear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About Lily, or the little ones?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no! only about yourself.&nbsp; Your father wished
me to speak to you, but I would not have done so on this first
meeting, but what you have just been saying makes me think this
is the best occasion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me know; I do not like suspense,&rsquo; said Jane,
sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it right to tell you, Jane, that neither your
father nor I thought it would be desirable for you to be
confirmed at this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you really mean it?&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look back on the past year, and say if you sincerely
think you are fit for confirmation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to that,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;the best people
are always saying that they are not fit for these
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None can call themselves worthy of them; but I think
the conscience of some would bear them witness that they had
profited so far by their present means of grace as to give
grounds for hoping that they would derive benefit from further
assistance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose I must be very bad, since you see
it,&rsquo; said Jane, in a manner rather more subdued; &lsquo;but
I did not think myself worse than other people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is a Christian called, only to be no worse than
others?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no!&nbsp; I see, I mean&mdash;pray tell me my great
fault.&nbsp; Pertness, I suppose&mdash;love of gossip?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be a deeper root of evil, of which these are
but the visible effects, Jane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, Robert?&rsquo; said Jane, now seeming
really impressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think, Jane, that the greatest and most dangerous
fault of your character is want of reverence.&nbsp; I think it is
want of reverence which makes you press forward to that for which
you confess yourself unfit; it is want of reverence for holiness
which makes you not care to attain it; want of reverence for the
Holy Word that makes you treat it as a mere lesson; and in
smaller matters your pertness is want of reverence for your
superiors; you would not be ready to believe and to say the worst
of others, if you reverenced what good there may be in
them.&nbsp; Take care that your want of reverence is not in
reality want of faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s spirits were weak and subdued.&nbsp; It was a
great shock to her to hear that she was not thought worthy of
confirmation; her faults had never been called by so hard a name;
she was in part humbled, and in part grieved, and what she
thought harshness in her cousin; she turned away her face, and
did not speak.&nbsp; He continued, &lsquo;Jane, you must not
think me unkind, your father desired me to talk to you, and,
indeed, the time of recovery from sickness is too precious to be
trifled away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane wept bitterly.&nbsp; Presently he said, &lsquo;It grieves
me to have been obliged to speak harshly to you, you must forgive
me if I have talked too much to you, Jane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane tried to speak, but sobs prevented her, and she gave way
to a violent fit of crying.&nbsp; Her cousin feared he had been
unwise in saying so much, and had weakened the effect of his own
words.&nbsp; He would have been glad to see tears of repentance,
but he was afraid that she was weeping over fancied unkindness,
and that he might have done what might be hurtful to her in her
weak state.&nbsp; He said a few kind words, and tried to console
her, but this change of tone rather added to her distress, and
she became hysterical.&nbsp; He was much vexed and alarmed, and,
ringing the bell, hastened to call assistance.&nbsp; He found
Esther, and sent her to Jane, and on returning to the schoolroom
with some water, he found her lying exhausted on the sofa; he
therefore went in search of his uncle, who was overlooking some
farming work, and many were the apologies made, and many the
assurances he received, that it would be better for her in the
end, as the impression would be more lasting.</p>
<p>Jane was scarcely conscious of her cousin&rsquo;s departure,
or of Esther&rsquo;s arrival, but after drinking some water, and
lying still for a few moments, she exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh, Robert!
oh, Esther! the confirmation!&rsquo; and gasped and sobbed
again.&nbsp; Esther thought she had guessed the cause of her
tears, and tried to comfort her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! Miss Jane, there will be another confirmation some
day; it was a sad thing you were too ill, to be sure,
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! if I had&mdash;if he would not say&mdash;if he had
thought me fit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esther was amazed, and asked if she should call Miss Weston,
who was now with Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; cried Jane, nearly relapsing into
hysterics.&nbsp; &lsquo;She shall not see me in this
state.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esther hardly knew what to do, but she tried to soothe and
comfort her by following what was evidently the feeling
predominating in Jane&rsquo;s mind, as indicated by her broken
sentences, and said, &lsquo;It was a pity, to be sure, that Mr.
Devereux came and talked so long, he could not know of your being
so very weak, Miss Jane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Jane, faintly, &lsquo;I could have
borne it better if he had waited a few days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss, when you had not been so very ill.&nbsp; Mr.
Devereux is a very good gentleman, but they do say he is very
sharp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He means to be kind,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;but I do
not think he has much consideration, always.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss Jane, that is just what Mrs. White said,
when&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esther&rsquo;s speech was cut short by the entrance of Miss
Weston.&nbsp; Jane started up, dashed off her tears, and tried to
look as usual, but the paleness of her face, and the redness of
her eyes, made this impossible, and she was obliged to lie down
again.&nbsp; Esther left the room, and Miss Weston did not feel
intimate enough with Jane to ask any questions; she gave her some
<i>sal volatile</i>, talked kindly to her of her weakness, and
offered to read to her; all the time leaving an opening for
confidence, if Jane wished to relieve her mind.&nbsp; The book
which lay near her accounted, as she thought, for her agitation,
and she blamed herself for having judged her harshly as deficient
in feeling, now that she found her so much distressed, because
illness had prevented her confirmation.&nbsp; Under this
impression she honoured her reserve, while she thought with more
affection of Lily&rsquo;s open heart.&nbsp; Jane, who never took,
or expected others to take, the most favourable view of
people&rsquo;s motives, thought Alethea knew the cause of her
distress, and disliked her the more, as having witnessed her
humiliation.</p>
<p>Such was Jane&rsquo;s love of gossip that the next time she
was alone with Esther she asked for the history of Mrs. White,
thus teaching her maid disrespect to her pastor, indirectly
complaining of his unkindness, and going far to annul the effect
of what she had learnt at school.&nbsp; Perhaps during her
hysterics Jane&rsquo;s conduct was not under control, but
subsequent silence was in her power, and could she be free from
blame if Esther&rsquo;s faults gained greater ascendency?</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Mohun attempted to speak to Jane, but being
both frightened and unhappy, she found it very easy and natural,
as well as very convenient, to fall into hysterics again, and her
father was obliged to desist, regretting that, at the only time
she was subdued enough to listen to reproof, she was too weak to
bear it without injury.&nbsp; Rachel, who was nearly as despotic
among the young ladies as she had been in former times in the
nursery, now insisted on Emily&rsquo;s going into the schoolroom,
and when there, she made rapid progress.&nbsp; Alethea was amused
to see how Jane&rsquo;s decided will and lively spirit would
induce Emily to make exertions, which no persuasions of hers
could make her think other than impossible.</p>
<p>A few days more, and they were nearly well again; and Lilias
so far recovered as to be able to spare her kind friend, who
returned home with a double portion of Lily&rsquo;s love, and of
deep gratitude from Mr. Mohun; but these feelings were scarcely
expressed in words.&nbsp; Emily gave her some graceful thanks,
and Jane disliked her more than ever.</p>
<p>It was rather a dreary time that now commenced with the young
ladies; they were tired of seeing the same faces continually, and
dispirited by hearing that the fever was spreading in the
village.&nbsp; The autumn was far advanced, the weather was damp
and gloomy, and the sisters sat round the fire shivering with
cold, feeling the large room dreary and deserted, missing the
merry voices of the children, and much tormented by want of
occupation.&nbsp; They could not go out, their hands were not
steady enough to draw, they felt every letter which they had to
write a heavy burden; neither Emily nor Lily could like
needlework; they could have no music, for the piano at the other
end of the room seemed to be in an Arctic Region, and they did
little but read novels and childish stories, and play at chess or
backgammon.&nbsp; Jane was the best off.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston sent
her a little sock, with a request that she would make out the way
in which it was knit, in a complicated feathery pattern, and in
puzzling over her cotton, taking stitches up and letting them
down, she made the time pass a little less heavily with her than
with her sisters.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">A CURIOSITY MAP</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Keek into the draw-well,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There ye&rsquo;ll see your bonny sell,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My jo Janet.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was at this time that Lady
Rotherwood and her daughter arrived at Devereux Castle, and Mr.
Mohun was obliged to go to meet her there, leaving his three
daughters to spend a long winter evening by themselves, in their
doleful and dismal way, as Lily called it.</p>
<p>The evening had closed in, but they did not ring for candles,
lest they should make it seem longer; and Jane was just beginning
to laugh at Emily for the deplorable state of her frock and
collar, tumbled with lying on the sofa, when the three girls all
started at the unexpected sound of a ring at the front door.</p>
<p>With a rapid and joyful suspicion who it might be, Emily and
Lilias sprang to the door, Jane thrust the poker into the fire,
in a desperate attempt to produce a flame, drove an arm-chair off
the hearth-rug, whisked an old shawl out of sight, and flew after
them into the hall, just as the deep tones of a well-known voice
were heard greeting old Joseph.</p>
<p>&lsquo;William!&rsquo; cried the girls.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! is it
you?&nbsp; Are you not afraid of the scarlet fever?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, who has it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have had it, but we are quite well now.&nbsp; How
cold you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But where is my father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone to Hetherington with Robert, to meet Aunt
Rotherwood.&nbsp; Come into the drawing-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Emily glided off to perform a hurried toilette.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the little ones?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At Broomhill.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston was so kind as to take
them out of the way of the infection,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; William, those Westons!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Westons, what Westons?&nbsp; Not those I knew at
Brighton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very same,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;They have
taken the house at Broomhill.&nbsp; Oh! they have been so very
kind, I do not know what would have become of us without
Alethea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you not tell me they were living here?&nbsp;
And you like them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like them!&nbsp; No one can tell the comfort Alethea
has been.&nbsp; She came to us and nursed us, and has been my
great support.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Phyllis and Ada are with them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, they have been at Broomhill these six weeks, and
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Emily came in and told William that his room was ready,
and Rachel on the stairs wishing to see the Captain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How well he looks!&rsquo; cried Lily, as he closed the
door; &lsquo;it is quite refreshing to see any one looking so
strong and bright.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And more like Sir Maurice than ever,&rsquo; said
Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but Claude is more like,&rsquo; said Lily,
&lsquo;because he is pale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;do let us in the
meantime make the room look more fit to be seen before he comes
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The alacrity which had long been wanting to Lilias and Jane
had suddenly returned, and they succeeded in making the room look
surprisingly comfortable, compared with its former desolate
aspect, before William came down, and renewed his inquiries after
all the family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how is my father&rsquo;s deafness?&rsquo; was one
of his questions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worse,&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid all
the younger ones will learn to vociferate.&nbsp; He hears no one
well but ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! and Alethea Weston,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Her voice is so clear and distinct, that she hardly ever
raises it to make him hear.&nbsp; And have you ever heard her
sing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she sings very well.&nbsp; I cannot think why you
never told me they were living here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you never honour us with your
correspondence,&rsquo; said Emily; &lsquo;if you had vouchsafed
to write to your sisters you could not have escaped hearing of
the Westons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And has Mr. Weston given up the law?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he only came home in the vacation,&rsquo; said
Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you know they had lost two
daughters?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw it in the paper.&nbsp; Emma and Lucy were nice
girls, but not equal to Miss Weston.&nbsp; What a shock to Mrs.
Weston!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she quite lost her health, and the doctors said
she must move into the country directly.&nbsp; Mrs. Carrington,
who is some distant connection, told them of this place, and they
took it rather hastily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do they like it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, very much!&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs.
Weston is very fond of the garden, and drives about in the
pony-carriage, and it is quite pleasant to see how she admires
the views.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; added Lily, &lsquo;Alethea walks with us,
and sings with me, and teaches at school, and knows all the poor
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go and see those children to-morrow,&rsquo; said
William.</p>
<p>The evening passed very pleasantly; and perhaps, in truth,
Captain Mohun and his sisters were surprised to find each other
so agreeable; for, in the eyes of the young ladies, he was by far
the most awful person in the family.</p>
<p>When he had been last at home Harry&rsquo;s recent death had
thrown a gloom over the whole family, and he had especially
missed him.&nbsp; Himself quick, sensible, clever, and active, he
was intolerant of opposite qualities, and the principal effect of
that visit to Beechcroft was to make all the younger ones afraid
of him, to discourage poor Claude, and to give to himself a
gloomy remembrance of that home which had lost its principal
charms in his mother and Harry.</p>
<p>He had now come home rather from a sense of duty than an
expectation of pleasure, and he was quite surprised to find how
much more attractive the New Court had become.&nbsp; Emily and
Lilias were now conversible and intelligent companions, better
suited to him than Eleanor had ever been, and he had himself in
these four years acquired a degree of gentleness and
consideration which prevented him from appearing so
unapproachable as in days of old.&nbsp; This was especially the
case with regard to Claude, whose sensitive and rather timid
nature had in his childhood suffered much from William&rsquo;s
boyish attempts to make him manly, and as he grew older, had
almost felt himself despised; but now William appreciated his
noble qualities, and was anxious to make amends for his former
unkindness.</p>
<p>Claude came home from Oxford, not actually ill, but in the
ailing condition in which he often was, just weak enough to give
his sisters a fair excuse for waiting upon him, and petting him
all day long.&nbsp; About the same time Phyllis and Adeline came
back from Broomhill, and there was great joy at the New Court at
the news that Mrs. Hawkesworth was the happy mother of a little
boy.</p>
<p>Claude was much pleased by being asked by Eleanor to be
godfather to his little nephew, whose name was to be Henry.&nbsp;
Perhaps he hoped, what Lilias was quite sure of, that Eleanor did
not think him unworthy to stand in Harry&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>The choice of the other sponsors did not meet with universal
approbation.&nbsp; Emily thought it rather hard that Mr.
Hawkesworth&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Ridley, should have been chosen
before herself, and both she and Ada would have greatly preferred
either Lord Rotherwood, Mr. Devereux, or William, to Mr. Ridley,
while Phyllis had wanderings of her own how Claude could be
godfather without being present at the christening.</p>
<p>One evening Claude was writing his answer to Eleanor, sitting
at the sofa table where a small lamp was burning.&nbsp; Jane,
attracted by its bright and soft radiance, came and sat down
opposite to him with her work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a silence!&rsquo; said Lily, after about a quarter
of an hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What made you start, Jane?&rsquo; said William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I?&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My speaking, I suppose,&rsquo; said Lily,
&lsquo;breaking the awful spell of silence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How red you look, Jane.&nbsp; What is the
matter?&rsquo; said William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do I?&rsquo; asked Jane, becoming still redder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is holding your face down over that baby&rsquo;s
hood,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;you will sacrifice the colour of
your nose to your nephew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude now asked Jane for the sealing-wax, folded up his
letter, sealed it, put on a stamp, and as Jane was leaving the
room at bedtime, said, &lsquo;Jenny, my dear, as you go by, just
put that letter in the post-bag.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane obeyed, and left the room.&nbsp; Claude soon after took
the letter out of the bag, went to Emily&rsquo;s door, listened
to ascertain that Jane was not there, and then knocked and was
admitted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not help coming,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to tell
you of the trap in which Brownie has been caught.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;I fancied I saw her
peeping slyly at your letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;and I hope she has
experienced the truth of an old proverb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! tell us what you have said,&rsquo; cried the
sisters.</p>
<p>Claude read, &lsquo;Jane desires me to say that a hood for the
baby shall be sent in the course of a week, and she hopes that it
may be worn at the christening.&nbsp; I should rather say I hope
it may be lost in the transit, for assuredly the head that it
covers must be infected with something far worse than the scarlet
fever&mdash;the fever of curiosity, the last quality which I
should like my godson to possess.&nbsp; My only consolation is,
that he will see the full deformity of the vice, as, poor little
fellow, he becomes acquainted with &ldquo;that worst of plagues,
a prying maiden aunt.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Jane was simply curious, I
should not complain, but her love of investigation is not
directed to what ought to be known, but rather to find out some
wretched subject for petty scandal, to blacken every action, and
to add to the weight of every misdeed, and all for the sake of
detailing her discoveries in exchange for similar information
with Mrs. Appleton, or some equally suitable
confidante.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And enough, too, I hope,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It ought to cure her!&rsquo; cried Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cure her!&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;no such thing;
cures are not wrought in this way; this is only a joke, and to
keep it up, I will tell you a piece of news, which Jane must have
spied out in my letter, as I had just written it when I saw her
eyes in a suspicious direction.&nbsp; It was settled that
Messieurs Maurice and Redgie are to go for two hours a day, three
times a week, to Mr. Stevens, during the holidays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The new Stoney Bridge curate?&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very glad you are not to be bored by them,&rsquo;
said Lily, &lsquo;but how they will dislike it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very hard upon them,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;and I tried to prevent it, but the Baron was quite
determined.&nbsp; Now I will begin to talk about this plan, and
see whether Jenny betrays any knowledge of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it will be rare!&rsquo; cried Lily; &lsquo;but do
not speak of it before the Baron or William.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it be at luncheon,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;you
know they never appear.&nbsp; Do you mean to send the
letter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that part of it,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;you see
I can tear off the last page, and it is only to add a new
conclusion.&nbsp; Good-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane had certainly not spent the evening in an agreeable
manner; she had not taken her seat at Claude&rsquo;s table with
any evil designs towards his letter, but his writing was clear
and legible, and her eye caught the word &lsquo;Maurice;&rsquo;
she wished to know what Claude could be saying about him, and
having once begun, she could not leave off, especially when she
saw her own name.&nbsp; When aware of the compliments he was
paying her, she looked at him, but his eyes were fixed on his
pen, and no smile, no significant expression betrayed that he was
aware of her observations; and even when he gave her the letter
to put into the post-bag he looked quite innocent and
unconcerned.&nbsp; On the other hand, she did not like to think
that he had been sending such a character of her to Eleanor in
sober sadness; it was impossible to find out whether he had sent
the letter; she could not venture to beg him to keep it back, she
could only trust to his good-nature.</p>
<p>At luncheon, as they had agreed, Lily began by asking where
her papa and William were gone?&nbsp; Claude answered, &lsquo;To
Stoney Bridge, to call upon Mr. Stevens; they mean to ask him to
dine one day next week, to be introduced to his
pupils.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he an Oxford or Cambridge man?&rsquo; asked
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oxford,&rsquo; exclaimed Jane, quite forgetting whence
she had derived her information, &lsquo;he is a fellow
of&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;how do you know
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, we have all been talking of him lately,&rsquo;
said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;why should he interest
us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he is to tutor the boys,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When did you hear that he is to tutor the boys?&rsquo;
asked Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you did, I suppose,&rsquo; said Jane,
blushing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did, did you?&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
feel convinced, if so, that you must really be what you are so
often called, a changeling.&nbsp; I heard it, or rather read it
first at Oxford, where the Baron desired me to make inquiries
about him.&nbsp; You were, doubtless, looking over my shoulder at
the moment.&nbsp; This is quite a discovery.&nbsp; We shall have
to perform a brewery of egg-shells this evening, and put the elf
to flight with a red-hot poker, and what a different sister Jane
we shall recover, instead of this little mischief-making sprite,
so quiet, so reserved, never intruding her opinion, showing
constant deference to all her superiors&mdash;yes, and to her
inferiors, shutting her eyes to the faults of others, and when
they come before her, trying to shield the offender from those
who regard them as merely exciting news.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude&rsquo;s speech had become much more serious than he
intended, and he felt quite guilty when he had finished, so that
it was not at all an undesirable interruption when Phyllis and
Adeline asked for the story of the brewery of egg-shells.</p>
<p>Emily and Lilias kindly avoided looking at Jane, who, after
fidgeting on her chair and turning very red, succeeded in
regaining outward composure.&nbsp; She resolved to let the matter
die away, and think no more about it.</p>
<p>When Mr. Mohun and William came home, they brought the news
that Lady Rotherwood had invited the whole party to dinner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very glad we are allowed to see them,&rsquo; said
Emily, &lsquo;I am quite tired of being shut up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it was not for the Westons we might as well live in
Nova Zembla,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you damsels should know a little more of
Florence,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;cousins were made to be
friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case one ought to be able to choose
them,&rsquo; said William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And know them,&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have
not seen Florence since she was eleven years old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cousin or not,&rsquo; said Lilias, &lsquo;Florence can
hardly be so much my friend as Alethea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right, Lily,&rsquo; said William, &lsquo;stand up for
old friends against all the cousins in the universe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has Alethea a right to be called an old friend?&rsquo;
said Emily; &lsquo;does three quarters of a year make friendship
venerable?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No one can deny that she is a tried friend,&rsquo; said
Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But pray, good people,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;what
called forth those vows of eternal constancy? why was my innocent
general observation construed into an attack upon Miss
Weston?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because there is something invidious in your
tone,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What kind of girl is that Florence?&rsquo; asked
William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! a nice, lively, pleasant girl,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot make out what her pursuits are,&rsquo; said
Lily; &lsquo;Rotherwood never talks of her reading
anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has been governessed and crammed till she is half
sick of all reading,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;of all
study&mdash;ay, and all accomplishments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that is the friend you recommend, Lily!&rsquo; said
William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Claude, that is what I call a great shame,&rsquo;
said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;you have heard but
half my story, I say that this is the reaction.&nbsp; Florence
has no lack of sense, and if you young ladies are wise, you may
help her to find the use of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude&rsquo;s further opinion did not transpire, as dinner
was announced, and nothing more was said about Lady Florence till
the girls had an opportunity of judging for themselves.&nbsp; She
had a good deal of her brother&rsquo;s vivacity, with gentleness
and grace, which made her very engaging, and her perfect
recollection of the New Court, and of childish days, charmed her
cousins.&nbsp; Lady Rotherwood was very kind and affectionate,
and held out hopes of many future meetings.&nbsp; The next day
Maurice and Reginald came home from school, bringing a better
character for diligence than usual, on which they founded hopes
that the holidays would be left to their own disposal.&nbsp; They
were by no means pleased with the arrangement made with Mr.
Stevens and most unwillingly did they undertake the expedition to
Stony Bridge, performing the journey in a very unsociable
manner.&nbsp; Maurice was no horseman, and chose to jog on foot
through three miles of lane, while Reginald&rsquo;s pony cantered
merrily along, its master&rsquo;s head being intent upon the
various winter sports in which William and Lord Rotherwood
allowed him to share.&nbsp; Little did Maurice care for such
diversions; he was, as Adeline said, studying another
&lsquo;apology.&rsquo;&nbsp; This time it was phrenology, for
which the cropped heads of Lilias and Jane afforded unusual
facility.&nbsp; There was, however, but a limited supply of heads
willing to be fingered, and Maurice returned to the most abiding
of his tastes, and in an empty room at the Old Court laboured
assiduously to find the secret of perpetual motion.</p>
<p>A few days before Christmas Rachel Harvey again took leave of
Beechcroft, with a promise that she would make them another visit
when Eleanor came home.&nbsp; Before she went she gave Emily a
useful caution, telling her it was not right to trust her keys
out of her own possession.&nbsp; It was what Miss Mohun never
would have done, she had never once committed them even to
Rachel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With due deference to Eleanor,&rsquo; said Emily, with
her winning smile, &lsquo;we must allow that that was being over
cautious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachel smiled, but her lecture was not averted by the
compliment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It might have been very well since you have known me,
Miss Emily, but I do not know what would have come of it, if I
had been too much trusted when I was a giddy young thing like
Esther; that girl comes of a bad lot, and if anything is to be
made of her, it is by keeping temptation out of her way, and not
letting her be with that mother of hers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachel had rather injured the effect of her advice by behaving
too like a mistress during her visit; Emily had more than once
wished that all servants were not privileged people, and she was
more offended than convinced by the remonstrance.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">CHRISTMAS</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Slee, sla, slud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuck in the mud,<br />
O! it is pretty to wade through a flood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, wheel round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dirt we have found,<br />
Would he an estate at a farthing a pound.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Lily&rsquo;s</span> illness interrupted
her teaching at the village school for many weeks, and she was in
no great haste to resume it.&nbsp; Alethea Weston seemed to enjoy
doing all that was required, and Lily left it in her hands, glad
to shut her eyes as much as possible to the disheartening state
the parish had been in ever since her former indiscretion.</p>
<p>The approach of Christmas, however, made it necessary for her
to exert herself a little more, and her interest in parish
matters revived as she distributed the clothing-club goods, and
in private conference with each good dame, learnt the wants of
her family.&nbsp; But it was sad to miss several names struck out
of the list for non-attendance at church; and when Mrs. Eden came
for her child&rsquo;s clothing, Lily remarked that the articles
she chose were unlike those of former years, the cheapest and
coarsest she could find.</p>
<p>St. Thomas&rsquo;s day was marked by the custom, called at
Beechcroft &lsquo;gooding.&rsquo;&nbsp; Each mother of a family
came to all the principal houses in the parish to receive
sixpence, towards providing a Christmas dinner, and it was
Lily&rsquo;s business to dispense this dole at the New
Court.&nbsp; With a long list of names and a heap of silver
before her, she sat at the oaken table by the open chimney in the
hall, returning a nod or a smiling greeting to the thanks of the
women as they came, one by one, to receive the little silver
coins, and warm themselves by the glowing wood fire.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Pleasant as the task was at first, it ended painfully.&nbsp;
Agnes Eden appeared, in order to claim the double portion
allotted to her mother, as a widow.&nbsp; This was the first time
that Mrs. Eden had asked for the gooding-money, and Lily knew
that it was a sign that she must be in great distress.&nbsp;
Agnes made her a little courtesy, and crept away again as soon as
she had received her shilling; but Mrs. Grey, who was Mrs.
Eden&rsquo;s neighbour, had not quite settled her penny-club
affairs, and remained a little longer.&nbsp; An unassuming and
lightly-principled person was Mrs. Grey, and Lily enjoyed a talk
with her, while she was waiting for the purple stuff frock which
Jane was measuring off for Kezia.&nbsp; They spoke of the
children, and of a few other little matters, and presently
something was said about Mrs. Eden; Lily asked if the blacksmith
helped her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! no, Miss Lilias, he will do nothing for her while
she sends her child to school and to church.&nbsp; He will not
speak to her even.&nbsp; Not a bit of butter, nor a morsel of
bacon, has been in her house since Michaelmas, and what she would
have done if it was not for Mr. Devereux and Mrs. Weston, I
cannot think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias, much shocked by this account of the distress into
which she and Jane had been the means of bringing the widow,
reported it to her father and to the Rector; entreating the
former to excuse her rent, which he willingly promised to do, and
also desired his daughters to give her a blanket, and tell her to
come to dine house whenever any broth was to be given away.&nbsp;
Mr. Devereux, who already knew of her troubles, and allowed her a
small sum weekly, now told his cousins how much the Greys had
assisted her.&nbsp; Andrew Grey had dug up and housed her
winter&rsquo;s store of potatoes, he had sought work for her, and
little Agnes often shared the meals of his children.&nbsp; The
Greys had a large family, very young, so that all that they did
for her was the fruit of self-denial.&nbsp; Innumerable were the
kindnesses which they performed unknown to any but the widow and
her child.&nbsp; More, by a hundred times, did they assist her,
than the thoughtless girls who had occasioned her sufferings,
though Lily was not the only one who felt that nothing was too
much for them to do.&nbsp; Nothing, perhaps, would have been too
much, except to bear her in mind and steadily aid her in little
things; but Lily took no account of little things, talked away
her feelings, and thus all her grand resolutions produced almost
nothing.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood sent Mrs. Eden a sovereign, the
girls newly clothed little Agnes, Phyllis sometimes carried her
the scraps of her dinner, Mrs. Eden once came to work at the New
Court, and a few messes of broth were given to her, but in
general she was forgotten, and when remembered, indolence or
carelessness too often prevented the Miss Mohuns from helping
her.&nbsp; In Emily&rsquo;s favourite phrase, each individual
thing was &lsquo;not worth while.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Lilias did think it &lsquo;worth while,&rsquo; she would
do a great deal upon impulse, sometimes with more zeal than
discretion, as she proved by an expedition which she took on
Christmas Eve.&nbsp; Mr. Mohun did not allow the poor of the
village to depend entirely on the gooding for their Christmas
dinner, but on the 24th of December a large mess of excellent
beef broth was prepared at the New Court, and distributed to all
his own labourers, and the most respectable of the other
cottagers.</p>
<p>In the course of the afternoon Lily found that one portion had
not been given out.&nbsp; It was that which was intended for the
Martins, a poor old rheumatic couple, who lived at South End, the
most distant part of the parish.&nbsp; Neither of them could walk
as far as the New Court, and most of their neighbours had
followed Farmer Gage, and had therefore been excluded from the
distribution, so that there was no one to send.&nbsp; Lily,
therefore, resolved herself to carry the broth to them, if she
could find an escort, which was not an easy matter, as the frost
had that morning broken up, and a good deal of snow and rain had
been falling in the course of the day.&nbsp; In the hall she met
Reginald, just turned out of Maurice&rsquo;s workshop, and much
at a loss for employment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Redgie,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you can do me a great
kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it is not a bore,&rsquo; returned Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only want you to walk with me to South
End.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said Reginald; &lsquo;I thought the little
Misses were too delicate to put their dear little proboscises
outside the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is the reason I ask you; I do not think Emily or
Jane would like it, and it is too far for Claude.&nbsp; Those
poor old Martins have not got their broth, and there is no one to
fetch it for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then do not be half an hour putting on your
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you; and do not run off, and make me spend an
hour in hunting for you, and then say that I made you
wait.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will wait fast enough.&nbsp; You are not so bad as
Emily,&rsquo; said Reginald, while Lily ran upstairs to equip
herself.&nbsp; When she came down, she was glad to find her
escort employed in singeing the end of the tail of the old
rocking-horse at the fire in the hall, so that she was not
obliged to seek him in the drawing-room, where her plans would
probably have met with opposition.&nbsp; She had, however,
objections to answer from an unexpected quarter.&nbsp; Reginald
was much displeased when she took possession of the pitcher of
broth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not walk with such a thing as that,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;it makes you look like one of the dirty girls in the
village.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you ought, like the courteous Rinaldo, to carry it
for me,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I touch the nasty thing!&nbsp; Faugh!&nbsp; Throw it
into the gutter, Lily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made an attempt to dispose of it in that manner, which it
required all Lily&rsquo;s strength to withstand, as well as an
imploring &lsquo;Now, Redgie, think of the poor old people.&nbsp;
Remember, you have promised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Promised!&nbsp; I never promised to walk with a greasy
old pitcher.&nbsp; What am I to do if we meet Miss
Weston?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily contrived to overcome Reginald&rsquo;s refined notions
sufficiently to make him allow her to carry the pitcher; and when
he had whistled up two of the dogs, they proceeded merrily along
the road, dirty and wet though it was.&nbsp; Their walk was not
entirely without adventures; first, they had to turn back in the
path by the river side, which would have saved them half a mile,
but was now flooded.&nbsp; Then, as they were passing through a
long lane, which led them by Edward Gage&rsquo;s farm, a great
dog rushed out of the yard, and fell upon the little terrier,
Viper.&nbsp; Old Neptune flew to the rescue, and to the great
alarm of Lily, Reginald ran up with a stick; happily, however, a
labourer at the same time came out with a pitchfork, and beat off
the enemy.&nbsp; These two delays, together with Reginald&rsquo;s
propensity for cutting sticks, and for breaking ice, made it
quite late when they arrived at South End.&nbsp; When there, they
found that a kind neighbour had brought the old people their
broth in the morning, and intended to go for her own when she
came home from her work in the evening.&nbsp; It was not often
that Lily went to South End; the old people were delighted to see
her, and detained her for some time by a long story about their
daughter at service, while Reginald looked the picture of
impatience, drumming on his knee, switching the leg of the table,
and tickling Neptune&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp; When they left the
cottage it was much later and darker than they had expected; but
Lily was unwilling again to encounter the perils of the lane, and
consulted her brother whether there was not some other way.&nbsp;
He gave notice of a cut across some fields, which would take them
into the turnpike road, and Lily agreeing, they climbed over a
gate into a pathless turnip field.&nbsp; Reginald strode along
first, calling to the dogs, while Lily followed, abstaining from
dwelling on the awkward circumstance that every step she took led
her farther from home, and rejoicing that it was so dark that she
could not see the mud which plastered the edge of her
petticoats.&nbsp; After plodding through three very long fields,
they found themselves shut in by a high hedge and tall ditch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That fool of a farmer!&rsquo; cried Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is to be done?&rsquo; said Lily,
disconsolately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is the road,&rsquo; said Reginald.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How do you propose to get into it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was a gap here last summer,&rsquo; said the
boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely!&nbsp; Come back; try the next field; it
must have a gate somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Back they went, after seeing the carrier&rsquo;s cart from
Raynham pass by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Redgie, it must be half-past five!&nbsp; We shall never
be in time.&nbsp; Aunt Rotherwood coming too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a desperate plunge through a swamp of ice, water, and
mud, they found themselves at a gate, and safely entered the
turnpike road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How it rains!&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
comfort is that it is too dark for any one to see us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not very dark, either,&rsquo; said Reginald; &lsquo;I
believe there is a moon if one could see it.&nbsp; Ha! here comes
some one on horseback.&nbsp; It is a gray horse; it is
William.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come to look for us,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
Redgie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coming home from Raynham,&rsquo; said Reginald.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do not fancy yourself so important, Lily.&nbsp; William,
is that you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reginald!&rsquo; exclaimed William, suddenly checking
his horse.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lily, what is all this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We set out to South End, to take the broth to the old
Martins, and we found the meadows flooded, which made us late;
but we shall soon be at home,&rsquo; said Lily, in a
make-the-best-of-it tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Soon?&nbsp; You are a mile and a half from home now,
and do you know how late it is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Half-past five,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Six, at least; how could you be so absurd?&rsquo;&nbsp;
William rode quickly on; Reginald laughed, and they plodded on;
at length a tall dark figure was seen coming towards them, and
Lily started, as it addressed her, &lsquo;Now what is the meaning
of all this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, William, have you come to meet us?&nbsp; Thank you;
I am sorry&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How were you to come through the village in the dark,
without some one to take care of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am taking care of her,&rsquo; said Reginald,
affronted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make haste; my aunt is come.&nbsp; How could you make
the people at home so anxious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>William gave Lily his arm, and on finding she was both tired
and wet, again scolded her, walked so fast that she was out of
breath, then complained of her folly, and blamed Reginald.&nbsp;
It was very unpleasant, and yet she was very much obliged to him,
and exceedingly sorry he had taken so much trouble.</p>
<p>They came home at about seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Jane met
them in the hall, full of her own and Lady Rotherwood&rsquo;s
wonderings; she hurried Lily upstairs, and&mdash;skilful, quick,
and ready&mdash;she helped her to dress in a very short
time.&nbsp; As they ran down Reginald overtook them, and they
entered the drawing-room as the dinner-bell was ringing.&nbsp;
William did not appear for some time, and his apologies were not
such as to smooth matters for his sister.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was for this very reason that Mr. Mohun allowed
Lily to escape with no more than a jesting reproof.&nbsp; Lord
Rotherwood wished to make his cousin&rsquo;s hardihood and
enterprise an example to his sister, and, in his droll
exaggerating way, represented such walks as every-day
occurrences.&nbsp; This was just the contrary to what Emily
wished her aunt to believe, and Claude was much diverted with the
struggle between her politeness to Lord Rotherwood and her desire
to maintain the credit of the family.</p>
<p>Lady Florence, though liking Lilias, thought this walk
extravagant.&nbsp; Emily feared Lilias had lost her aunt&rsquo;s
good opinion, and prepared herself for some hints about a
governess.&nbsp; It was untoward; but in the course of the
evening she was a little comforted by a proposal from Lady
Rotherwood to take her and Lilias to a ball at Raynham, which was
to take place in January; and as soon as the gentlemen appeared,
they submitted the invitation to their father, while Lady
Rotherwood pressed William to accompany them, and he was
refusing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are soldiers intended for but to dance!&rsquo;
said Lord Rotherwood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never dance,&rsquo; said William, with a grave
emphasis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am out of the scrape,&rsquo; said the Marquis.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall be gone before it takes place; I reserve all my
dancing for July 30th.&nbsp; Well, young ladies, is the Baron
propitious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He says he will consider of it,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh then, he will let you go,&rsquo; said Florence,
&lsquo;people never consider when they mean no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Florence,&rsquo; said her brother, &lsquo;Uncle
Mohun&rsquo;s &ldquo;consider of it&rdquo; is equivalent to Le
Roi&rsquo;s &ldquo;avisera.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is he saying?&rsquo; asked Lily, turning to
listen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, that my wig is in no ball-going
condition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wreath would hide all deficiencies,&rsquo; said
Florence; &lsquo;I am determined to have you both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I give small hopes of both,&rsquo; said Claude;
&lsquo;you will only have Emily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you think so, Claude?&rsquo; cried both Florence
and Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From my own observation,&rsquo; Claude answered,
gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very angry with the Baron,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood; &lsquo;he is grown inhospitable: he will not let me
come here to-morrow&mdash;the first Christmas these five years
that I have missed paying my respects to the New Court sirloin
and turkey.&nbsp; It is too bad&mdash;and the Westons dining here
too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cousin Turkey-cock, well may you be in a
passion,&rsquo; muttered Claude, as if in soliloquy.</p>
<p>Lord Rotherwood and Lilias both caught the sound, and laughed,
but Emily, unwilling that Florence should see what liberties they
took with her brother, asked quickly why he was not to come.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think we are much obliged to him,&rsquo; said
Florence, &lsquo;it would be too bad to leave mamma and me to
spend our Christmas alone, when we came to the castle on purpose
to oblige him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, and he says he will not let me come here, because I
ought to give the Hetherington people ocular demonstration that I
go to church,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very right, as Eleanor would say,&rsquo; observed
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely; but I don&rsquo;t care for the
Hetherington folks; they do not know how to make the holly in the
church fit to be seen, and they will not sing the good old
Christmas carols.&nbsp; Andrew Grey is worth all the Hetherington
choir put together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Possibly; but how are they to mend, if their Marquis
contents himself with despising them?&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is too bad, Claude.&nbsp; When you heard how
submissively I listened to the Baron, and know I mean to abide by
what he said, you ought to condole with me a little, if you have
not the grace to lament my absence on your own account.&nbsp;
Why, I thought myself as regular a part of the feast as the
mince-pies, and almost as necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here a request for some music put an end to his
lamentations.&nbsp; Lilias was vexed by the uncertainty about the
ball, and was, besides, too tired to play with spirit.&nbsp; She
saw that Emily was annoyed, and she felt ready to cry before the
evening was over; but still she was proud of her exploit, and
when, after the party was gone, Emily began to represent to her
the estimate that her aunt was likely to form of her character,
she replied, &lsquo;If she thinks the worse of me for carrying
the broth to those poor old people, I am sure I do not wish for
her good opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mohun was not propitious when the question of Lily&rsquo;s
going to the ball was pressed upon him.&nbsp; He said that he
thought her too young for gaieties, and, besides, that late hours
never agreed with her, and he advised her to wait for the 30th of
July.</p>
<p>Lilias knew that it was useless to say any more.&nbsp; She was
much disappointed, and at the same time provoked with herself for
caring about such a matter.&nbsp; Her temper was out of order on
Christmas Day; and while she wondered why she could not enjoy the
festival as formerly, with thoughts fitted to the day, she did
not examine herself sufficiently to find out the real cause of
her uncomfortable feelings.</p>
<p>The clear frost was only cold; the bright sunshine did not
rejoice her; the holly and the mistletoe seemed ill arranged; and
none of the pleasant sights of the day could give her such
blitheness as once she had known.</p>
<p>She was almost angry when she saw that the Westons had left
off their mourning, declaring that they did not look like
themselves; and her vexation came to a height when she found that
Alethea actually intended to go to the ball with Mrs.
Carrington.&nbsp; The excited manner in which she spoke of it
convinced Mr. Mohun that he had acted wisely in not allowing her
to go, since the very idea seemed to turn her head.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MINOR MISFORTUNES</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Loving she is,
and tractable though wild.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a day or two Lady Rotherwood and
her daughter called at the New Court.&nbsp; On this occasion
Lilias was employed in as rational and lady-like a manner as
could be desired&mdash;in practising her music in the
drawing-room; Emily was reading, and Ada threading beads.</p>
<p>Lady Rotherwood greeted her nieces very affectionately, gave a
double caress to Adeline, stroked her pretty curls, admired her
beadwork, talked to her about her doll, and then proceeded to
invite the whole family to a Twelfth-Day party, given for their
especial benefit.&nbsp; The little Carringtons and the Weston
girls were also to be asked.&nbsp; Emily and Lilias were eagerly
expressing their delight when suddenly a trampling, like a charge
of horse, was heard in the hall; the door was thrown back, and in
rushed Reginald and Phyllis, shouting, &lsquo;Such fun!&mdash;the
pigs are in the garden!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the sight of their aunt they stopped short, looking aghast,
and certainly those who beheld them partook of their
consternation.&nbsp; Reginald was hot and gloveless; his shoes
far from clean; his brown curls hanging in great disorder from
his Scotch cap; his handkerchief loose; his jacket
dusty&mdash;but this was no great matter, since, as Emily said,
he was &lsquo;only a boy.&rsquo;&nbsp; His bright open smile, the
rough, yet gentleman-like courtesy of his advance to the
Marchioness, his comical roguish glance at Emily, to see if she
was very angry, and to defy her if she were, and his speedy exit,
all greatly amused Lady Florence, and made up for what there
might have been of the wild schoolboy in his entrance.</p>
<p>Poor Phyllis had neither the excuse of being a schoolboy nor
the good-humoured fearlessness that freed her brother from
embarrassment, and she stood stock-still, awkward and dismayed,
not daring to advance; longing to join in the pig-chase, yet
afraid to run away, her eyes stretched wide open, her hair
streaming into them, her bonnet awry, her tippet powdered with
seeds of hay, her gloves torn and soiled, the colour of her brown
holland apron scarcely discernible through its various stains,
her frock tucked up, her stockings covered with mud, and without
shoes, which she had taken off at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phyllis,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;what are you
thinking of?&nbsp; What makes you such a figure?&nbsp; Come and
speak to Aunt Rotherwood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis drew off her left-hand glove, and held out her hand,
making a few sidelong steps towards her aunt, who gave her a
rather reluctant kiss.&nbsp; Lily bent her bonnet into shape, and
pulled down her frock, while Florence laughed, patted her cheek,
and asked what she had been doing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Helping Redgie to chop turnips,&rsquo; was the
answer.</p>
<p>Afraid of some further exposure, Emily hastily sent her away
to be made fit to be seen, and Lady Rotherwood went on caressing
Ada and talking of something else.&nbsp; Emily had no opportunity
of explaining that this was not Phyllis&rsquo;s usual condition,
and she was afraid that Lady Rotherwood would never believe that
it was accidental.&nbsp; She was much annoyed, especially as the
catastrophe only served to divert Mr. Mohun and Claude.&nbsp; Of
all the family William and Adeline alone took her view of the
case.&nbsp; Ada lectured Phyllis on her
&lsquo;naughtiness,&rsquo; and plumed herself on her aunt&rsquo;s
evident preference, but William was not equally
sympathetic.&nbsp; He was indeed as fastidious as Emily herself,
and as much annoyed by such misadventures; but he maintained that
she was to blame for them, saying that the state of things was
not such as it should be, and that the exposure might be
advantageous if it put her on her guard in future.</p>
<p>It appeared as if poor Phyllis was to be punished for the
vexation which she had caused, for in the course of her
adventures with Reginald she caught a cold, which threatened to
prevent her from being of the party on Twelfth-Day.&nbsp; She had
a cough, which did not give her by any means as much
inconvenience as the noise it occasioned did to other
people.&nbsp; Every morning and every evening she anxiously asked
her sisters whether they thought she would be allowed to
go.&nbsp; Another of the party seemed likely to fail.&nbsp; On
the 5th of January Claude came down to breakfast later even than
usual; but he had no occasion to make excuses, for his heavy
eyes, the dark lines under them, his pale cheeks, and the very
sit of his hair, were sure signs that he had a violent
headache.&nbsp; He soon betook himself to the sofa in the
drawing-room, attended by Lily, with pillows, cushions, ether,
and lavender.&nbsp; Late in the afternoon the pain diminished a
little, and he fell asleep, to the great joy of his sister, who
sat watching him, scarcely daring to move.</p>
<p>Suddenly a frightful scream and loud crash was heard in the
room above them.&nbsp; Claude started up, and Lily, exclaiming,
&lsquo;Those tiresome children!&rsquo; hurried to the room whence
the noise had come.</p>
<p>Reginald, Phyllis, and Ada, all stood there laughing.&nbsp;
Reginald and Phyllis had been climbing to the top of a great
wardrobe, by means of a ladder of chairs and tables.&nbsp; While
Phyllis was descending her brother had made some demonstration
that startled her, and she fell with all the chairs over her, but
without hurting herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You naughty troublesome child,&rsquo; cried Lily, in no
gentle tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;How often have you been told to leave
off such boyish tricks!&nbsp; And you choose the very place for
disturbing poor Claude, with his bad headache, making it worse
than ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis tried to speak, but only succeeded in giving a dismal
howl.&nbsp; She went on screaming, sobbing, and roaring so loud
that she could not hear Lily&rsquo;s attempts to quiet her.&nbsp;
The next minute Claude appeared, looking half distracted.&nbsp;
Reginald ran off, and as he dashed out of the room, came full
against William, who caught hold of him, calling out to know what
was the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only Phyllis screaming,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, Claude, I am very sorry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought
some one was half killed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sank into a chair, pressing his hand on his temples, and
looking very faint.&nbsp; William supported him, and Lily stood
by, repeating, &lsquo;I am very sorry&mdash;it was all my
fault&mdash;my scolding&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; said William, &lsquo;you have done
mischief enough.&nbsp; Go away, children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis had already gone, and the next moment thrust into
Lily&rsquo;s hand the first of the medicaments which she had
found in the drawing-room.&nbsp; The faintness soon went off, but
Claude thought he had better not struggle against the headache
any longer, but go to bed, in hopes of being better the next
day.&nbsp; William went with him to his room, and Lilias lingered
on the stairs, very humble, and very wretched.&nbsp; William soon
came forth again, and asked the meaning of the uproar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was all my fault,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;I was
vexed at Claude&rsquo;s being waked, and that made me speak
sharply to Phyllis, and set her roaring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know which is the most inconsiderate of
you,&rsquo; said William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot blame me more than I deserve,&rsquo; said
Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;May I go to poor Claude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose so; but I do not see what good you are to
do.&nbsp; Quiet is the only thing for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily, however, went, and Claude gave her to understand that he
liked her to stay with him.&nbsp; She arranged his blinds and
curtains comfortably, and then sat down to watch him.&nbsp;
William went to the drawing-room to write a letter.&nbsp; Just as
he had sat down he heard a strange noise, a sound of sobbing,
which seemed to come from the corner where the library steps
stood.&nbsp; Looking behind them, he beheld Phyllis curled up,
her head on her knees, crying bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You there!&nbsp; Come out.&nbsp; What is the matter
now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so very sorry,&rsquo; sighed she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, leave off crying.&rsquo;&nbsp; She would
willingly have obeyed, but her sobs were beyond her own control;
and he went on, &lsquo;If you are sorry, there is no more to be
said.&nbsp; I hope it will be a lesson to you another time.&nbsp;
You are quite old enough to have more consideration for other
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry,&rsquo; again said Phyllis, in a
mournful note.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be sorry, only do not roar.&nbsp; You make that noise
from habit, I am convinced, and you may break yourself off it if
you choose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis crept out of the room, and in a few minutes more the
door was softly opened by Emily, returning from her walk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought Claude was here.&nbsp; Is he gone to
bed?&nbsp; Is his head worse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, the children have been doing their best to
distract him.&nbsp; Emily, I want to know why it is that those
children are for ever in mischief and yelling in all parts of the
house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could help it,&rsquo; said Emily, with a sigh;
&lsquo;they are very troublesome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be great mismanagement,&rsquo; said her
brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, William!&nbsp; Why do you think so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Other children do not go on in this way, and it was not
so in Eleanor&rsquo;s time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only Phyllis,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phyllis or not, it ought not to be.&nbsp; What will
that child grow up, if you let her be always running wild with
the boys?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Consider, William, that you see us at a disadvantage;
we are all unsettled by this illness, and the children have been
from home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if they learnt all these wild tricks at
Broomhill!&nbsp; That excuse will not do, Emily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then they are always worse in the holidays,&rsquo;
pleaded Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there are reasons to be found for everything that
goes wrong; but if you were wise you would look deeper.&nbsp;
Now, Emily, I do not wish to be hard upon you, for I know you are
in a very difficult position, and very young for such a charge,
but I am sure you might manage better.&nbsp; I do not think you
use your energies.&nbsp; There is no activity, nor regularity,
nor method, about this household.&nbsp; I believe that my father
sees that this is the case, but it is not his habit to find fault
with little things.&nbsp; You may think that, therefore, I need
not interfere, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, William!&nbsp; I am glad&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But remember that comfort is made up of little
things.&nbsp; And, Emily, when you consider how much my father
has suffered, and how desolate his home must be at the best, I
think you will be inclined to exert yourself to prevent him from
being anxious about the children or harassed by your
negligence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, William,&rsquo; returned Emily, with many
tears, &lsquo;it is my most earnest wish to make him
comfortable.&nbsp; Thank you for what you have said.&nbsp; Now
that I am stronger, I hope to do more, and I will really do my
best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Emily was sincere; but the good impulse of one
instant was not likely to endure against long cherished habits of
selfish apathy.</p>
<p>Claude did not appear again till the middle of the next
day.&nbsp; His headache was nearly gone, but he was so languid
that he gave up all thoughts of Devereux Castle that
evening.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood, who always seemed to know what
was going on at Beechcroft, came to inquire for him, and very
unwillingly allowed that it would be better for him to stay at
home.&nbsp; Lilias wished to remain with him; but this her cousin
would not permit, saying that he could not consent to lose three
of the party, and Florence would be disappointed in all her
plans.&nbsp; Neither would Claude hear of keeping her at home,
and she was obliged to satisfy herself with putting his arm-chair
in his favourite corner by the fire, with the little table before
it, supplied with books, newspaper, inkstand, paper-knife, and
all the new periodicals, and he declared that he should enjoy the
height of luxury.</p>
<p>Phyllis considered it to be entirely her fault that he could
not go, and was too much grieved on that account to have many
regrets to spare for herself.&nbsp; She enjoyed seeing Adeline
dressed, and hearing Esther&rsquo;s admiration of her.&nbsp; And
having seen the party set off, she made her way into the
drawing-room, opening the door as gently as possible, just wide
enough to admit her little person, then shutting it as if she was
afraid of hurting it, she crept across the room on tiptoe.&nbsp;
She started when Claude looked up and said, &lsquo;Why, Phyl, I
have not seen you to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning,&rsquo; she mumbled, advancing in her
sidelong way.</p>
<p>Claude suspected that she had been more blamed the day before
than the occasion called for, and wishing to make amends he
kissed her, and said something good-natured about spending the
evening together.</p>
<p>Phyllis, a little reassured, went to her own
occupations.&nbsp; She took out a large heavy volume, laid it on
the window-seat, and began to read.&nbsp; Claude was interested
in his own book, and did not look up till the light failed
him.&nbsp; He then, closing his book, gave a long yawn, and
looked round for his little companion, almost thinking, from the
stillness of the room, that she must have gone to seek for
amusement in the nursery.</p>
<p>She was, however, still kneeling against the window-seat, her
elbows planted on the great folio, and her head between her
hands, reading intently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little Madam,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what great book
have you got there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>As You Like It</i>,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! are you promoted to reading
Shakspeare?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not read any but this,&rsquo; said
Phyllis.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ada and I have often looked at the
pictures, and I liked the poor wounded stag coming down to the
water so much, that I read about it, and then I went on.&nbsp;
Was it wrong, Claude? no one ever told me not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are welcome to read it,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;but not now&mdash;it is too dark.&nbsp; Come and sit in
the great chair on the other side of the fire, and be
sociable.&nbsp; And what do you think of &lsquo;<i>As You Like
It</i>?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like it very much,&rsquo; answered Phyllis,
&lsquo;only I cannot think why <i>Jacks</i> did not go to the
poor stag, and try to cure it, when he saw its tears running into
the water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To save the character of <i>Jacks</i>, Claude gravely
suggested the difficulty of catching the stag, and then asked
Phyllis her opinion of the heroines.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it was very funny about Rosalind dressing like a
man, and then being ready to cry like a girl when she was tired,
and then pretending to pretend to be herself; and Celia, it was
very kind of her to go away with Rosalind; but I should have
liked her better if she had stayed at home, and persuaded her
father to let Rosalind stay too.&nbsp; I am sure she would if she
had been like Ada.&nbsp; Then it is so nice about Old Adam and
Orlando.&nbsp; Do not you think so, Claude?&nbsp; It is just what
I am sure Wat Greenwood would do for Redgie, if he was to be
turned out like Orlando.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is just what Wat Greenwood&rsquo;s ancestor did for
Sir Maurice Mohun,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Dame Greenwood tells us that story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Phyl, I think you show very good taste in liking
the scene between Orlando and Adam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you like it, too, Claude.&nbsp; But I will
tell you what I like best,&rsquo; exclaimed the little girl,
springing up, &lsquo;I do like it, when Orlando killed the
lioness and the snake,&mdash;and saved Oliver; how glad he must
have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glad to have done good to his enemy,&rsquo; said
Claude; &lsquo;yes, indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His enemy! he was his brother, you know.&nbsp; I meant
it must be so very nice to save anybody&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
think so, Claude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Claude, do you know there is nothing I wish so much as
to save somebody&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; It was very nice to save the
dragon-fly; and it is very nice to let flies out of
spiders&rsquo; webs, only they always have their legs and wings
torn, and look miserable; and it was very nice to put the poor
little thrushes back into their nest when they tumbled out, and
then to see their mother come to feed them; and it was very
pleasant to help the poor goose that had put its head through the
pales, and could not get it back.&nbsp; Mrs. Harrington said it
would have been strangled if I had not helped it.&nbsp; That was
very nice, but how delightful it would be to save some real human
person&rsquo;s life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude did not laugh at the odd medley in her speech, but
answered, &lsquo;Well, those little things train you in readiness
and kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will they?&rsquo; said Phyllis, pressing on to express
what had long been her earnest wish.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I could but
save some one, I should not mind being killed myself&mdash;I
think not&mdash;I hope it is not naughty to say so.&nbsp; I
believe there is something in the Bible about it, about laying
down one&rsquo;s life for one&rsquo;s friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is, Phyl, and I quite agree with you; it must be
a great blessing to have saved some one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And little girls have sometimes done it, Claude.&nbsp;
I know a story of one who saved her little brother from drowning,
and another waked the people when the house was on fire.&nbsp;
And when I was at Broomhill, Marianne showed me a story of a
young lady who helped to save the Prince, that Prince Charlie
that Miss Weston sings about.&nbsp; I wish the Prince of Wales
would get into some misfortune&mdash;I should like to save
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not quite echo that loyal wish,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, but, Claude, Redgie wishes for a rebellion, like
Sir Maurice&rsquo;s, for he says all the boys at his school would
be one regiment, in green velvet coats, and white feathers in
their hats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed! and Redgie to be Field Marshal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he is to be Sir Reginald Mohun, a Knight of the
Garter, and to ask the Queen to give William back the title of
Baron of Beechcroft, and make papa a Duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done! he is to take good care of the interests of
the family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is not that that I should care about,&rsquo;
said Phyllis.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should like it better for the
feeling in one&rsquo;s own self; I think all that fuss would
rather spoil it&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, Claude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I do; but Phyllis, if you only wish for that
feeling, you need not look for dangers or rebellions to gain
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! you mean the feeling that very good people indeed
have&mdash;people like Harry&mdash;but that I shall never
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you mean to try, though.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do try; I wish I was as good as Ada, but I am so
naughty and so noisy that I do not know what to do.&nbsp; Every
day when I say my prayers I think about being quiet, and not
idling at my lessons, and sometimes I do stop in time, and behave
better, but sometimes I forget, and I do not mind what I am
about, and my voice gets loud, and I let the things tumble down
and make a noise, and so it was yesterday.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here she
looked much disposed to cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, we will not have any crying this
evening,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not think you did
me much mischief, my head ached just as much before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was a thing I wanted to ask you about: William
says my crying loud is all habit, and that I must cure myself of
it.&nbsp; How does he mean?&nbsp; Ought I to cry every day to
practise doing it without roaring?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you like to begin,&rsquo; said Claude, laughing;
&lsquo;shall I beat you or pinch you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it would make your head bad again,&rsquo; said
Phyllis; &lsquo;but I wish you would tell me what he means.&nbsp;
When I cry I only think about what makes me unhappy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Try never to cry,&rsquo; said Claude; &lsquo;I assure
you it is not pleasant to hear you, even when I have no
headache.&nbsp; If you wish to do anything right, you must learn
self-control, and it will be a good beginning to check yourself
when you are going to cry.&nbsp; Do not look melancholy
now.&nbsp; Here comes the tea.&nbsp; Let me see how you will
perform as tea-maker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish the evening would not go away so
fast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what are we to do after tea?&nbsp; You are queen of
the evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you would but tell me a story, Claude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They lingered long over the tea-table, talking and laughing,
and when they had finished, Phyllis discovered with surprise that
it was nearly bedtime.&nbsp; The promised story was not omitted,
however, and Phyllis, sitting on a little footstool at her
brother&rsquo;s feet, looked up eagerly for it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Phyl, I will tell you a true history that I heard
from an officer who had served in the Peninsular War&mdash;the
war in Spain, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, with the French, who killed their king.&nbsp; Lily
told me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the Portuguese were helping us.&nbsp; Just after we
had taken the town of Ciudad Rodrigo, some of the Portuguese
soldiers went to find lodgings for themselves, and, entering a
magazine of gunpowder, made a fire on the floor to dress their
food.&nbsp; A most dangerous thing&mdash;do you know
why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The book would be burnt,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What book, you wise child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Magazine; I thought a magazine was one of the paper
books that Maurice is always reading.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Claude, laughing, &lsquo;a magazine is
a store, and as many different things are stored in those books,
they are called magazines.&nbsp; A powder magazine is a store of
barrels of gunpowder.&nbsp; Now do you see why it was dangerous
to light a fire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It blows up,&rsquo; said Phyllis; &lsquo;that was the
reason why Robinson Crusoe was afraid of the
lightning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right, Phyl, and therefore a candle is never allowed to
be carried into a powder magazine, and even nailed shoes are
never worn there, lest they should strike fire.&nbsp; One spark,
lighting on a grain of gunpowder, scattered on the floor, might
communicate with the rest, make it all explode, and spread
destruction everywhere.&nbsp; Think in what fearful peril these
reckless men had placed, not only themselves, but the whole town,
and the army.&nbsp; An English officer chanced to discover them,
and what do you think he did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Told all the people to run away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could he have told every one, soldiers,
inhabitants, and all? where could they have gone?&nbsp; No, he
raised no alarm, but he ordered the Portuguese out of the
building, and with the help of an English sergeant, he carried
out, piece by piece, all the wood which they had set on
fire.&nbsp; Now, imagine what that must have been.&nbsp; An
explosion might happen at any moment, yet they had to walk
steadily, slowly, and with the utmost caution, in and out of this
place several times, lest one spark might fly back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then they were saved?&rsquo; cried Phyllis,
breathlessly; &lsquo;and what became of them
afterwards?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were both killed in battle, the officer, I
believe, in Badajoz, and the sergeant sometime
afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis gave a deep sigh, and sat silent for some
minutes.&nbsp; Next, Claude began a droll Irish fairy-tale, which
he told with spirit and humour, such as some people would have
scorned to exert for the amusement of a mere child.&nbsp; Phyllis
laughed, and was so happy, that when suddenly they heard the
sound of wheels, she started up, wondering what brought the
others home so soon, and was still more surprised when Claude
told her it was past ten.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear! what will papa and Emily say to me for being
up still?&nbsp; But I will stay now, it would not be fair to
pretend to be gone to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well said, honest Phyl; now for the news from the
castle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Claude,&rsquo; said his eldest brother, entering,
&lsquo;you are alive again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I doubt whether your evening could have been pleasanter
than ours,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phyl,&rsquo; cried Ada, &lsquo;do you know, Mary
Carrington&rsquo;s governess thought I was Florence&rsquo;s
sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You look so bright, Claude,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;I
think you must have taken Cinderella&rsquo;s friend with the
pumpkin to enliven you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My fairy was certainly sister to a Brownie,&rsquo; said
Claude, stroking Phyllis&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Claude,&rsquo; again began Ada, &lsquo;Miss
Car&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish Cinderella&rsquo;s fairy may be forthcoming the
day of the ball,&rsquo; said Lily, disconsolately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And William is going after all,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed! has the great Captain relented?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Is it not good of him?&nbsp; Aunt Rotherwood
is so much pleased that he consents to go entirely to oblige
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sensible of his condescension,&rsquo; said
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the bye, what makes the Baron look so
mischievous?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mischievous!&rsquo; said Emily, looking round with a
start, &lsquo;he is looking very comical, and so he has been all
the evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&nbsp; You thought mischievous was meant in
Hannah&rsquo;s sense, when she complains of Master Reginald being
very mischie-vi-ous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ada now succeeded in saying, &lsquo;The Carringtons&rsquo;
governess called me Lady Ada.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could she bring herself to utter so horrid a
sound?&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ada is more cock-a-hoop than ever now,&rsquo; said
Reginald; &lsquo;she does not think Miss Weston good enough to
speak to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Claude, she really did, she thought I was
Florence&rsquo;s sister, and she said I was just like
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would hold your tongue, or go to bed,&rsquo;
said William, &lsquo;I have heard nothing but this nonsense all
the way home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While William was sending off Ada to bed, and Phyllis was
departing with her, Lily told Claude that the Captain had been
most agreeable.&nbsp; &lsquo;I feared,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;that he would be too grand for this party, but he was
particularly entertaining; Rotherwood was quite
eclipsed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rotherwood wants Claude to set him off,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, young ladies, reserve the rest of your
adventures for the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Adeline had full satisfaction in recounting the
governess&rsquo;s mistake to the maids, and in hearing from
Esther that it was no wonder, &lsquo;for that she looked more
like a born lady than Lady Florence herself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias&rsquo;s fit of petulance about the ball had returned
more strongly than ever; she partly excused herself to her own
mind, by fancying she disliked the thought of the lonely evening
she was to spend more than that of losing the pleasure of the
ball.&nbsp; Mr. Mohun would be absent, conducting Maurice to a
new school, and Claude and Reginald would also be gone.</p>
<p>Her temper was affected in various ways; she wondered that
William and Emily could like to go&mdash;she had thought that
Miss Weston was wiser.&nbsp; Her daily occupations were
irksome&mdash;she was cross to Phyllis.</p>
<p>It made her very angry to be accused by the young brothers of
making a fuss, and Claude&rsquo;s silence was equally
offensive.&nbsp; It was upon principle that he said
nothing.&nbsp; He knew it was nothing but a transient attack of
silliness, of which she was herself ashamed; but he was sorry to
leave her in that condition, and feared Lady Rotherwood&rsquo;s
coming into the neighbourhood was doing her harm, as certainly as
it was spoiling Ada.&nbsp; The ball day arrived, and it was
marked by a great burst of fretfulness on the part of poor
Lilias, occasioned by so small a matter as the being asked by
Emily to write a letter to Eleanor.&nbsp; Emily was dressing to
go to dine at Devereux Castle when she made the request.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have I to say?&nbsp; I never could write a letter
in my life, at least not to the Duenna&mdash;there is no
news.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About the boys going to school,&rsquo; Emily
suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if she did not know all about them as well as I can
tell her.&nbsp; She does not care for my news, I see no one to
hear gossip from.&nbsp; I thought you undertook all the formal
correspondence, Emily?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you call a letter to your sister formal
correspondence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything is formal with her.&nbsp; All I can say is,
that you and William are going to the ball, and she will say that
is very silly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eleanor once went to this Raynham ball; it was her
first and last,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, not long before they went to Italy; it will only
make her melancholy to speak of it&mdash;I declare I cannot
write.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I have no time,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;and you
know how vexed she is if she does not get her letter every
Saturday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All for the sake of punctuality, nothing else,&rsquo;
said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I rather like to disappoint fidgety
people&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, Emily?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;only papa does not like
that she should be disappointed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have written, if you had not dawdled away all
the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was true, and it therefore stung Emily, who complained
that Lily was very unkind.&nbsp; Lily defended herself sharply,
and the dispute was growing vehement, when William happily cut it
short by a summons to Emily to make haste.</p>
<p>When they were gone Lily had time for reflection.&nbsp;
Good-temper was so common a virtue, and generally cost her so
little effort, that she took no pains to cultivate it, but she
now felt she had lost all claim to be considered amiable under
disappointment.&nbsp; It was too late to bear the privation with
a good grace.&nbsp; She was heartily ashamed of having been so
cross about a trifle, and ashamed of being discontented at
Emily&rsquo;s having a pleasure in which she could not
share.&nbsp; Would this have been the case a year ago?&nbsp; She
was afraid to ask herself the question, and without going deep
enough into the history of her own mind to make her sorrow and
shame profitable, she tried to satisfy herself with a superficial
compensation, by making herself particularly agreeable to her
three younger sisters, and by writing a very long and
entertaining letter to Eleanor.</p>
<p>She met Emily with a cheerful face the next day, and listened
with pleasure to her history of the ball; and when Mr. Mohun
returned home he saw that the cloud had passed away.&nbsp; But,
alas!&nbsp; Lilias neglected to take the only means of preventing
its recurrence.</p>
<p>The next week William departed.&nbsp; Before he went he gave
his sisters great pleasure by desiring them to write to him, and
not to let him fall into his ancient state of ignorance
respecting the affairs of Beechcroft.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind,&rsquo; was his farewell speech, &lsquo;I expect
you to keep me <i>au courant du jour</i>.&nbsp; I will not be in
the dark about your best friends and neighbours when I come home
next July.&rsquo;</p>

186</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">VANITY AND VEXATION</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And still I have to tell the same sad
tale<br />
Of wasted energies, and idle dreams.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Devereux Castle</span> now became the
great resort of the Miss Mohuns.&nbsp; They were always sure of a
welcome there.&nbsp; Lady Rotherwood liked to patronise them, and
Florence was glad of their society.</p>
<p>This was quite according to the wishes of Emily, who now had
nothing left to desire, but that the style of dress suitable, in
her opinion, to the granddaughter of the Marquis of Rotherwood,
was more in accordance with the purse of the daughter of the
Esquire of Beechcroft.&nbsp; It was no part of Emily&rsquo;s
character to care for dress.&nbsp; She was at once too indolent
and too sensible; she saw the vulgarity of finery, and only aimed
at simplicity and elegance.&nbsp; During their girlhood Emily and
Lilias had had no more concern with their clothes than with their
food; Eleanor had carefully taught them plain needlework, and
they had assisted in making more than one set of shirts; but they
had nothing to do with the choice or fashion of their own
apparel.&nbsp; They were always dressed alike, and in as plain
and childish a manner as they could be, consistently with their
station.&nbsp; On Eleanor&rsquo;s marriage a suitable allowance
was given to each of them, in order that they might provide their
own clothes, and until Rachel left them they easily kept
themselves in very good trim.&nbsp; When Esther came Lily
cheerfully took the trouble of her own small decorations,
considering it as her payment for the pleasure of having Esther
in the house.&nbsp; Emily, however, neglected the useful
&lsquo;stitch in time,&rsquo; till even &lsquo;nine&rsquo; were
unavailing.&nbsp; She soon found herself compelled to buy new
ready-made articles, and expected Lilias to do the same.&nbsp;
But Lilias demurred, for she was too wise to think it necessary
to ruin herself in company with Emily, and thus the two sisters
were no longer dressed alike.&nbsp; A constant fear tormented
Emily lest she should disgrace Lady Rotherwood, or be considered
by some stranger as merely a poor relation of the great people,
and not as the daughter of the gentleman of the oldest family in
the county.&nbsp; She was, therefore, anxious to be perfectly
fashionable, and not to wear the same things too often, and in
her disinterested desire to maintain the dignity of the family
the allowance which she received at Christmas melted away in her
hands.</p>
<p>Lily, though exempt from this folly, was not in a satisfactory
state of mind.&nbsp; She was drawn off from her duties by a kind
of spell.&nbsp; It was not that she liked Florence&rsquo;s
society better than her home pursuits.</p>
<p>Florence was indeed a very sweet-tempered and engaging
creature; but her mind was not equal to that of Lilias, and there
was none of the pleasure of relying upon her, and looking up to
her, which Lilias had learnt to enjoy in the company of her
brother Claude, and of Alethea Weston.&nbsp; It was only that
Lily&rsquo;s own mind had been turned away from her former
occupations, and that she did not like to resume them.&nbsp; She
had often promised herself to return to her really useful
studies, and her positive duties, as soon as her brothers were
gone; but day after day passed and nothing was done, though her
visits to the cottages and her lessons to Phyllis were often
neglected.&nbsp; Her calls at Devereux Castle took up many
afternoons.&nbsp; Florence continually lent her amusing books,
her aunt took great interest in her music, and she spent much
time in practising.&nbsp; The mornings were cold and dark, and
she could not rise early, and thus her time slipped away, she
knew not how, uselessly and unsatisfactorily.&nbsp; The three
younger ones were left more to themselves, and to the
maids.&nbsp; Jane sought for amusement in village gossip, and the
little ones, finding the nursery more agreeable than the deserted
drawing-room, made Esther their companion.</p>
<p>Mr. Mohun had, at this time, an unusual quantity of business
on his hands; he saw that the girls were not going on well, but
he had reasons for not interfering at present, and he looked
forward to Eleanor&rsquo;s visit as the conclusion of their
trial.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot think,&rsquo; said Marianne Weston one day to
her sister, &lsquo;why Mr. Mohun comes here so often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alethea told her he had some business with their mamma, and
she thought no more of the matter, till she was one day
questioned by Jane.&nbsp; She was rather afraid of Jane, who, as
she thought, disliked her, and wished to turn her into ridicule;
so it was with no satisfaction that she found herself separated
from the others in the course of a walk, and submitted to a
cross-examination.</p>
<p>Jane asked, in a mysterious manner, who had been at Broomhill
that morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Mohun,&rsquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did he go there for?&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alethea says he has some business with
mamma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you did not hear what it was?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was not in the room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you never there when he comes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sometimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is Alethea there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His business must be with her too.&nbsp; Cannot you
guess it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Marianne, looking amazed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you be so slow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not sure that I would guess if I could,&rsquo;
said Marianne, &lsquo;for I do not think they wish me to
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! nonsense, it is fine fun to find out
secrets,&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will know it at last,
you may be sure, so there can be no harm in making it out
beforehand, so as to have the pleasure of triumph when the wise
people vouchsafe to admit you into their confidence; I am sure I
know it all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then please do not tell me, Jane, I ought not to hear
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little Mrs. Propriety,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;you are
already assuming all the dignity of my Aunt Marianne, and
William&rsquo;s Aunt Marianne&mdash;oh! and of little
Henry&rsquo;s Great-aunt Marianne.&nbsp; Now,&rsquo; she added,
laughing, &lsquo;can you guess the secret?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marianne stood still in amazement for a moment, and then
exclaimed, &lsquo;Jane, Jane! you do not mean it, you are only
trying to tease me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite serious,&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
will see that I am right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here they were interrupted, and as soon as she returned from
her walk Marianne, perplexed and amazed, went to her mother, and
told her all that Jane had said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can she be so silly?&rsquo; said Mrs. Weston.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is all nonsense, as I thought,&rsquo; said
Marianne, joyfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should not like Alethea to
marry an old man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Mohun is very unlikely to make himself
ridiculous,&rsquo; said Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do not say
anything of it to Alethea; it would only make her
uncomfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it had been Captain Mohun, now&mdash;&rsquo;
Marianne stopped, and blushed, finding her speech unanswered.</p>
<p>A few days after, Mr. Mohun overtook Marianne and her mother,
as he was riding home from Raynham, and dismounting, led his
horse, and walked on with them.&nbsp; Either not perceiving
Marianne, or not caring whether she heard him, he said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has Miss Weston received the letter she
expected?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mrs. Weston, &lsquo;she thinks, as
there is no answer, the family must be gone abroad, and very
probably they have taken Miss Aylmer with them; but she has
written to another friend to ask about them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From all I hear,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;I should
prefer waiting to hear from her, before we make further
inquiries; we shall not be ready before midsummer, as I should
wish my eldest daughter to assist me in making this important
decision.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; said Mrs. Weston, &lsquo;there
will be plenty of time to communicate with her.&nbsp; I can see
some of the friends of the family when I go to London, for we
must not leave Mr. Weston in solitude another spring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I shall see you there,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have some business in London, and I think I
shall meet the Hawkesworths there in May or June.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a little more conversation Mr. Mohun took his leave, and
as soon as he had ridden on, Marianne said, &lsquo;Oh! mamma, I
could not help hearing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Weston, &lsquo;I know you may
be trusted; but I should not have told you, as you may find such
a secret embarrassing when you are with your young
friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so they are to have a governess?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and we are trying to find Miss Aylmer for
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Aylmer!&nbsp; I am glad of it; how much Phyllis
and Ada will like her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it will be very good for them; I wish I knew the
Grants&rsquo; direction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I hope Jane will not question me any more; it
will be very difficult to manage, now I know the
truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But poor Marianne was not to escape.&nbsp; Jane was on the
watch to find her alone, and as soon as an opportunity offered,
she began:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, auntie, any discoveries?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Jane, it is not right to fancy Mr. Mohun can do
anything so absurd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is as people may think,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would not talk in that way,&rsquo; said
Marianne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Marianne,&rsquo; pursued the tormentor, &lsquo;if
you can explain the mystery I will believe you, otherwise I know
what to think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am certain you are wrong, Jane; but I can tell you no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, my good aunt, I am satisfied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane really almost persuaded herself that she was right, as
she perceived that her father was always promoting intercourse
with the Westons, and took pleasure in conversing with
Alethea.&nbsp; She twisted everything into a confirmation of her
idea; while the prospect of having Miss Weston for a stepmother
increased her former dislike; but she kept her suspicions to
herself for the present, triumphing in the idea that, when the
time came, she could bring Marianne as a witness of her
penetration.</p>
<p>The intercourse between the elder Miss Mohuns and Miss Weston
was, however, not so frequent as formerly; and Alethea herself
could not but remark that, while Mr. Mohun seemed to desire to
become more intimate, his daughters were more backward in making
appointments with her.&nbsp; This was chiefly remarkable in Emily
and Jane.&nbsp; Lilias was the same in openness, earnestness, and
affection; but there was either a languor about her spirits or
they were too much excited, and her talk was more of novels, and
less of poor children than formerly.&nbsp; The constant visits to
Devereux Castle prevented Emily and Lilias from being as often as
before at church, and thus they lost many walks and talks that
they used to enjoy in the way home.&nbsp; Marianne began to grow
indignant, especially on one occasion, when Emily and Lily went
out for a drive with Lady Rotherwood, forgetting that they had
engaged to take a walk with the Westons that afternoon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is really a great deal too bad,&rsquo; said she to
Alethea; &lsquo;it is exactly what we have read of in books about
grandeur making people cast off their old friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not be unfair, Marianne,&rsquo; said Alethea.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lady Florence has a better right to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better right!&rsquo; exclaimed Marianne.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What, because she is a marquis&rsquo;s
daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because she is their cousin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not believe Lilias really cares for her half as
much as for you,&rsquo; said Marianne.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is all
because they are fine people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, Marianne, if our cousins were to come into this
neighbourhood, we should not be as dependent on the Mohuns as we
now feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope we should not break our engagements with
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps they could not help it.&nbsp; When their aunt
came to fetch them, knowing how seldom they can have the
carriage, it would have been scarcely civil to say that they had
rather take a walk with people they can see any day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Last year Lilias would have let Emily go by
herself,&rsquo; said Marianne.&nbsp; &lsquo;Alethea, they are all
different since that Lady Rotherwood came&mdash;all except
Phyl.&nbsp; Ada is a great deal more conceited than she was when
she was staying here; she pulls out her curls, and looks in the
glass much more, and she is always talking about some one having
taken her for Lady Florence&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; And, Alethea,
just fancy, she does not like me to go through a gate before her,
because she says she has precedence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alethea was much amused, but she would not let Marianne
condemn the whole family for Ada&rsquo;s folly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
will all come right,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;let us be patient
and good-humoured, and nothing can be really wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Alethea made the best of it to her sister, she could
not but feel hurt, and would have been much more so if her temper
had been jealous or sentimental.&nbsp; Almost in spite of herself
she had bestowed upon Lilias no small share of her affection, and
she would have been more pained by her neglect if she had not
partaken of that spirit which &lsquo;thinketh no evil, but
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, and
endureth all things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias was not satisfied with either herself, her home, her
sisters, or her school; she was far from being the fresh, happy
creature that she had been the year before.&nbsp; She had seen
the fallacy of her principle of love, but in her self-willed
adherence to it she had lost the strong sense and habit of duty
which had once ruled her; and in a vague and restless frame of
mind, she merely sought from day to day for pleasure and idle
occupation.&nbsp; Lent came, but she was not roused, she was only
more uncomfortable when she saw the Rector, or Alethea, or went
to church.&nbsp; Alethea&rsquo;s unfailing gentleness she felt
almost as a rebuke; and Mr. Devereux, though always kind and
good-natured, had ceased to speak to her of those small village
matters in which she used to be prime counsellor.</p>
<p>The school became a burthen instead of a delight, and her
attendance there a fatigue.&nbsp; On going in one Sunday morning,
very late, she found Alethea teaching her class as well as her
own.&nbsp; With a look of vexation she inquired, as she took her
place, if it was so very late, and on the way to church she said
again, &lsquo;I thought I was quite in time; I do not like to
hurry the children&mdash;the distant ones have not time to
come.&nbsp; It was only half-past nine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Lilias,&rsquo; said Marianne, &lsquo;it was twenty
minutes to ten, I know, for I had just looked at the
clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That clock is always too fast,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>The next Sunday was very cold, and Lilias did not feel at all
disposed to leave the fire when the others prepared to go to the
afternoon school.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it time?&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was chilled
at church, and my feet are still like ice; I will follow you in
five minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alethea went, and Lilias lingered by the fire.&nbsp; Mrs.
Weston once asked her if she knew how late it was; but still she
waited, until she was startled by the sound of the bell for
evening service.&nbsp; As she went to church with Mrs. Weston and
Emily she met Jane, who told her that her class had been
unemployed all the afternoon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would have taken them,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but
that Robert does not like me to teach the great girls, and I do
think Alethea might have heard them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very provoking,&rsquo; said Lily, pettishly;
&lsquo;I thought I might depend&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; She turned
and saw Miss Weston close to her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
Alethea!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I thought you would have heard
those girls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you were coming,&rsquo; said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I was, but I am sure the bell rang too early.&nbsp;
I do wish you had taken them, Alethea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry you are vexed,&rsquo; said Alethea,
simply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What makes you think I am vexed?&nbsp; I only thought
you liked hearing my class.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were by this time at the church door, and as they entered
Alethea blamed herself for feeling grieved, and Lily awoke to a
sense of her unreasonableness.&nbsp; She longed to tell Alethea
how sorry she felt, but she had no opportunity, and she resolved
to go to Broomhill the next day to make her confession.&nbsp; In
the night, however, snow began to fall, and the morning showed
the February scene of thawing snow and pouring rain.&nbsp; Going
out was impossible, both on that day and the next.&nbsp;
Wednesday dawned fair and bright; but just after breakfast Lily
received a little note, with the intelligence that Mr. Weston had
arrived at Broomhill on Monday evening, and with his wife and
daughters was to set off that very day to make a visit to some
friends on the way to London.&nbsp; Had not the weather been so
bad, Alethea said she should have come to take leave of her New
Court friends on Tuesday, but she could now only send this note
to tell them how sorry she was to go without seeing them, and to
beg Emily to send back a piece of music which she had lent to
her.&nbsp; The messenger was Faith Longley, who was to accompany
them, and who now was going home to take leave of her mother, and
would call again for the music in a quarter of an hour.&nbsp;
Lily ran to ask her when they were to go.&nbsp; &lsquo;At
eleven,&rsquo; was the answer; and Lily telling her she need not
call again, as she herself would bring the music, went to look
for it.&nbsp; High and low did she seek, and so did Jane, but it
was not to be found in any nook, likely or unlikely; and when at
last Lily, in despair, gave up the attempt to find it, it was
already a quarter to eleven.&nbsp; Emily sent many apologies and
civil messages, and Lily set out at a rapid pace to walk to
Broomhill by the road, for the thaw had rendered the fields
impassable.&nbsp; Fast as she walked, she was too late.&nbsp; She
had the mortification of seeing the carriage turn out at the
gates, and take the Raynham road; she was not even seen, nor had
she a wave of the hand, or a smile to comfort her.</p>
<p>Almost crying with vexation, she walked home, and sat down to
write to Alethea, but, alas! she did not know where to direct a
letter.&nbsp; Bitterly did she repent of the burst of ill-temper
which had stained her last meeting with her friend, and she was
scarcely comforted even by the long and affectionate letter which
she received a week after their departure.&nbsp; Kindness from
her was now forgiveness; never did she so strongly feel
Florence&rsquo;s inferiority; and she wondered at herself for
having sought her society so much as to neglect her patient and
superior friend.&nbsp; She became careless and indifferent to
Florence, and yet she went on in her former course, following
Emily, and fancying that nothing at Beechcroft could interest her
in the absence of her dear Alethea Weston.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;O guide us when our faithless hearts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Thee would start aloof,<br />
Where patience her sweet skill imparts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath some cottage roof.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Palm Sunday</span> brought Lily many
regrets.&nbsp; It was the day of the school prize giving, and she
reflected with shame, how much less she knew about the children
than last year, and how little they owed to her; she feared to
think of the approach of Easter Day, a dread which she had never
felt before, and which she knew to be a very bad sign; but her
regret was not repentance&mdash;she talked, and laughed, and
tried to feel at ease.&nbsp; Agnes Eden&rsquo;s happy face was
the most pleasant sight on that day.&nbsp; The little girl
received a Bible, and as it was given to her her pale face was
coloured with bright pink, her blue eyes lighted up, her smile
was radiant with the beauty of innocence, but Lily could not look
at her without self-reproach.&nbsp; She resolved to make up for
her former neglect by double kindness, and determined that, at
any rate, Passion Week should be properly spent&mdash;she would
not once miss going to church.</p>
<p>But on Monday, when Emily proposed to ride to Devereux Castle,
she assented, only saying that they would return for evening
service.&nbsp; She took care to remind her sister when it was
time to set out homewards; but Emily was, as usual, so long in
taking her leave that it was too late to think of going to church
when they set off.</p>
<p>About two miles from Beechcroft Lily saw a little figure in a
gray cloak trudging steadily along the road, and as she came
nearer she recognised Kezia Grey.&nbsp; She stopped and asked the
child what brought her so far from home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going for the doctor, Miss,&rsquo; said the
child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is your mother worse?&rsquo; asked Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother is pretty well,&rsquo; said Kezia; &lsquo;but it
is for Agnes Eden, Miss&mdash;she is terrible bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little Agnes!&rsquo; exclaimed Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, she was at school yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss, but she was taken bad last night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s consultation between the sisters, Kezia
was told that she might return home, and the servant who
accompanied the Miss Mohuns was sent to Raynham for the
doctor.&nbsp; The next afternoon Lily was just setting out to
inquire for Agnes when Lord Rotherwood arrived at the New Court
with his sister.&nbsp; He wanted to show Florence some of his
favourite haunts at Beechcroft, and had brought her to join his
cousins in their walk.&nbsp; A very pleasant expedition they
made, but it led them so far from home that the church bell was
heard pealing over the woods far in the distance.&nbsp; Lily
could not go to Mrs. Eden&rsquo;s cottage, because she did not
know the nature of Agnes&rsquo;s complaint, and her aunt could
not bear that Florence should go into any house where there was
illness.&nbsp; In the course of the walk, however, she met Kezia,
on her way to the New Court, to ask for a blister for Agnes, the
doctor having advised Mrs. Eden to apply to the Miss Mohuns for
one, as it was wanted quickly, and it was too far to send to
Raynham.&nbsp; Lily promised to send the blister as soon as
possible, and desired the little messenger to return home, where
she was much wanted, to help her mother, who had a baby of less
than a week old.</p>
<p>Alas! in the mirth and amusement of the evening Lily entirely
forgot the blister, until just as she went to bed, when she made
one of her feeble resolutions to take it, or send it early in the
morning.&nbsp; She only awoke just in time to be ready for
breakfast, went downstairs without one thought of the sick child,
and never recollected her, until at church, just before the
Litany, she heard these words: &lsquo;The prayers of the
congregation are desired for Agnes Eden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She felt as if she had been shot, and scarcely knew where she
was for several moments.&nbsp; On coming out of church, she stood
almost in a dream, while Emily and Jane were talking to the
Rector, who told them how very ill the child was, and how little
hope there was of her recovery.&nbsp; He took leave of them, and
Lily walked home, scarcely hearing the soothing words with which
Emily strove to comfort her.&nbsp; The meaning passed away
mournfully; Lily sat over the fire without speaking, and without
attempting to do anything.&nbsp; In the afternoon rain came on;
but Lily, too unhappy not to be restless, put on her bonnet and
cloak, and went out.</p>
<p>She walked quickly up the hill, and entered the field where
the cottage stood.&nbsp; There she paused.&nbsp; She did not dare
to knock at the cottage door; she could not bear to speak to Mrs.
Eden; she dreaded the sight of Mrs. Grey or Kezia, and she gazed
wistfully at the house, longing, yet fearing, to know what was
passing within it.&nbsp; She wandered up and down the field, and
at last was trying to make up her mind to return home, when she
heard footsteps behind her, and turning, saw Mr. Devereux
advancing along the path at the other end of the field.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been to inquire for Agnes?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not.&nbsp; I long to know, but I cannot bear to
ask, I cannot venture in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you like to go in with me?&rsquo; said her
cousin.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not think you will see anything
dreadful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;I would give
anything to know about her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How you tremble! but you need not be afraid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He knocked at the door, but there was no answer; he opened it,
and going to the foot of the stairs, gently called Mrs. Eden, who
came down calm and quiet as ever, though very pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No better, sir, thank you, light-headed
still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Mrs. Eden, I am so sorry,&rsquo; sobbed
Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! can you forgive me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray do not take on so, Miss,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Eden.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have always been a very kind friend to
her, Miss Lilias.&nbsp; Do not take on so, Miss.&nbsp; If it is
His will, nothing could have made any difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily was going to speak again, but Mr. Devereux stopped her,
saying, &lsquo;We must not keep Mrs. Eden from her,
Lily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir, her aunt is with her,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Eden, &lsquo;and no one is any good there now, she does not know
any one.&nbsp; Will you walk up and see her, sir? will you walk
up, Miss Lilias?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily silently followed her cousin up the narrow stairs to the
upper room, where, in the white-curtained bed, lay the little
child, tossing about and moaning, her cheeks flushed with fever,
and her blue eyes wide open, but unconscious.&nbsp; A woman, whom
Lily did not at first perceive to be Mrs. Naylor, rose and
courtsied on their entrance.&nbsp; Agnes&rsquo;s new Bible was
beside her, and her mother told them that she was not easy if it
was out of sight for an instant.</p>
<p>At this moment Agnes called out, &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; and
Mrs. Eden bent down to her, but she only repeated,
&lsquo;Mother&rsquo; two or three times, and then began
talking:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kissy, I want my bag&mdash;where is my
thimble&mdash;no, not that I can&rsquo;t remember&mdash;my
catechism-book&mdash;my godfathers and godmothers in my baptism,
wherein I was made a member&mdash;my Christian name&mdash;my
name, it is my Christian name; no, that is not it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is a name by which I am<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Writ in the hook of life,<br />
And here below a charm to keep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unharmed by sin and strife;<br />
As often as my name I hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear my Saviour&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then she began the Creed, but, breaking off, exclaimed,
&lsquo;Where is my Bible, mother, I shall read it
to-morrow&mdash;read that pretty verse about &ldquo;I am the good
Shepherd&mdash;the Lord is my Shepherd, therefore can I lack
nothing&mdash;yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art within me.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I now am of that little flock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which Christ doth call His own,<br />
For all His sheep He knows by name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And He of them is known.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Let us call upon your good Shepherd, Agnes,&rsquo; said
the pastor, and the child turned her face towards him as if she
understood him.&nbsp; Kneeling down, he repeated the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer, and the feeble voice followed his.&nbsp; He then read the
prayer for a sick child, and left the room, for he saw that Lily
would be quite overcome if she remained there any longer.&nbsp;
Mrs. Eden followed them downstairs, and again stung poor Lily to
the heart by thanks for all her kindness.</p>
<p>They then left the house of mourning; Lily trembled violently,
and clung to her cousin&rsquo;s arm for support.&nbsp; Her tears
streamed fast, but her sobs were checked by awe at Mrs.
Eden&rsquo;s calmness.&nbsp; She felt as if she had been among
the angels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How pale you are!&rsquo; said her cousin, &lsquo;I
would not have taken you there if I thought it would overset you
so much.&nbsp; Come into Mrs. Grey&rsquo;s, and sit down and
recover a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, do not let me see any one,&rsquo; said
Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! that dear child!&nbsp; Robert, let me tell
you the worst, for your kindness is more than I can bear.&nbsp; I
promised Agnes a blister and forgot it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could say no more for some minutes, but her cousin did not
speak.&nbsp; Recovering her voice, she added, &lsquo;Only speak
to me, Robert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry for you,&rsquo; answered he, in a kind
tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But tell me, what shall I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What to do, you ask,&rsquo; said the Rector; &lsquo;I
am not sure that I know what you mean.&nbsp; If your neglect has
added to her sufferings, you cannot remove them; and I would not
add to your sorrow unless you wished me to do so for your
good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not see how I could be more unhappy than I am
now,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think if you wish to turn your grief to good account
you must go a little deeper than this omission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean that it is a result of general
carelessness,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;I know I have been in an
odd idle way for some time; I have often resolved, but I seem to
have no power over myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I ask you one question, Lily?&nbsp; How have you
been spending this Lent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert, you are right,&rsquo; cried Lily; &lsquo;you
may well ask.&nbsp; I know I have not gone to church properly,
but how could you guess the terrible way in which I have been
indulging myself, and excusing myself every unpleasant duty that
came in my way?&nbsp; That was the very reason of this dreadful
neglect; well do I deserve to be miserable at Easter, the proper
time for joy.&nbsp; Oh! how different it will be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be, I hope, an Easter marked by repentance and
amendment,&rsquo; said the Rector.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Robert, do not begin to be kind to me yet, you do
not know how very bad I have been,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;it
all began from just after Eleanor&rsquo;s wedding.&nbsp; A mad
notion came into my head and laid hold of me.&nbsp; I fancied
Eleanor stern, and cold, and unlovable; I was ingratitude
itself.&nbsp; I made a foolish theory, that regard for duty makes
people cold and stern, and that feeling, which I confused with
Christian love, was all that was worth having, and the more
Claude tried to cure me, the more obstinate I grew; I drew Emily
over to my side, and we set our follies above everything.&nbsp;
Justified ourselves for idling, neglecting the children,
indulging ourselves, calling it love, and so it was,
self-love.&nbsp; So my temper has been spoiling, and my mind
getting worse and worse, ever since we lost Eleanor.&nbsp; At
last different things showed me the fallacy of my principle, but
then I do believe I was beyond my own management.&nbsp; I felt
wrong, and could not mend, and went on recklessly.&nbsp; You know
but too well what mischief I have done in the village, but you
can never know what harm I have done at home.&nbsp; I have seen
more and more that I was going on badly, but a sleep, a spell was
upon me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps the pain you now feel may be the means of
breaking the spell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is it not enough to drive me mad to think that
improvement in me should be bought at such a price&mdash;the
widow&rsquo;s only child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You forget that the loss is a blessing to
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still I may pray that my punishment may not be through
them,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; was the answer, &lsquo;it is grievous to
see that dear child cut off; and her patient mother left
desolate&mdash;yet how much more grievous it would be to see that
spotless innocence defiled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it was to fall on any one,&rsquo; said Lilias,
&lsquo;I should be thankful that it is on one so fit to
die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The church bell began to ring, and they quickened their steps
in silence.&nbsp; Presently Lily said, &lsquo;Tell me of
something to do, Robert, something that may be a pledge that my
sorrow is not a passing shower, something unnecessary, but
disagreeable, which may keep me in remembrance that my Lent was
not one of self-denial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must be able to find more opportunities of
self-denial than I can devise,&rsquo; said her cousin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;but some one thing,
some punishment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will answer you to-morrow,&rsquo; said Mr.
Devereux.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One thing more,&rsquo; said Lily, looking down;
&lsquo;after this great fall, ought I to come to next
Sunday&rsquo;s feast?&nbsp; I would turn away if you thought
fit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lily, you can best judge,&rsquo; said the Rector,
kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should think that you were now in a
humble, contrite frame, and therefore better prepared than when
self-confident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many times! how shall I think of them! but I
will,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;and Robert, will you think of me
when you say the Absolution now and next Sunday at the
altar?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were by this time at the church-porch.&nbsp; As Mr.
Devereux uncovered his head, he turned to Lilias, and said in a
low tone, &lsquo;God bless you, Lilias, and grant you true
repentance and pardon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Early the next morning the toll of the passing-bell informed
Lily that the little lamb had been gathered into the heavenly
fold.</p>
<p>When she took her place in church she found in her Prayer-book
a slip of paper in the handwriting of her cousin.&nbsp; It was
thus: &lsquo;You had better find out in which duty you have most
failed, and let the fulfilment of that be your proof of
self-denial.&nbsp; R. D.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards Lily learnt that Agnes had been sensible for a
short time before her peaceful death.&nbsp; She had spoken much
of her baptism, had begged to be buried next to a little sister
of Kezia&rsquo;s, and asked her mother to give her new Bible to
Kezia.</p>
<p>It was not till Sunday that Lilias felt as if she could ever
be comforted.&nbsp; Her heart was indeed ready to break as she
walked at the head of the school children behind the
white-covered coffin, and she felt as if she did not deserve to
dwell upon the child&rsquo;s present happiness; but afterwards
she was relieved by joining in prayer for the pardon of our sins
and negligences, and she felt as if she was forgiven, at least by
man, when she joined with Mrs. Eden in the appointed feast of
Easter Day.</p>
<p>Mrs. Naylor was at church on that and several following
Sundays; but though her husband now showed every kindness to his
sister, he still obstinately refused to be reconciled to Mr.
Devereux.</p>
<p>For many weeks poor little Kezia looked very unhappy.&nbsp;
Her blithe smiles were gone, her eyes filled with tears whenever
she was reminded of her friend, she walked to school alone, she
did not join the sports of the other children, but she kept close
to the side of Mrs. Eden, and seemed to have no pleasure but with
her, or in nursing her little sister, who, two Sundays after the
funeral, was christened by the name of Agnes.</p>
<p>It was agreed by Mr. Mohun and Lilias that the grave of the
little girl should be marked by a stone cross, thus
inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Agnes Eden</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">April 8th, 1846,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Aged 7 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;He shall gather the lambs in
His arms.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">DOUBLE, DOUBLE TOIL AND
TROUBLE</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Truly the tender mercies of the weak,<br />
As of the wicked, are but cruel.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> how did Lilias show that she
had been truly benefited by her sorrows?&nbsp; Did she fall back
into her habits of self-indulgence, or did she run into
ill-directed activity, selfish as her indolence, because only
gratifying the passion of the moment?</p>
<p>Those who lived with her saw but little change; kind-hearted
and generous she had ever been, and many had been her good
impulses, so that while she daily became more steady in
well-doing, and exerting herself on principle, no one remarked
it, and no one entered into the struggles which it cost her to
tame her impetuosity, or force herself to do what was
disagreeable to herself, and might offend Emily.</p>
<p>However, Emily could forgive a great deal when she found that
Lily was ready to take any part of the business of the household
and schoolroom, which she chose to impose upon her, without the
least objection, yet to leave her to assume as much of the credit
of managing as she chose&mdash;to have no will or way of her own,
and to help her to keep her wardrobe in order.</p>
<p>The schoolroom was just now more of a labour than had ever
been the case, at least to one who, like Lilias, if she did a
thing at all, would not be satisfied with half doing it.&nbsp;
Phyllis was not altered, except that she cried less, and had in a
great measure cured herself of dawdling habits and tricks, by her
honest efforts to obey well-remembered orders of Eleanor&rsquo;s;
but still her slowness and dulness were trying to her teachers,
and Lily had often to reproach herself for being angry with her
&lsquo;when she was doing her best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Adeline was Lily&rsquo;s principal trouble; there was a
change in her, for which her sister could not account.&nbsp; Last
year, when Eleanor left them, Ada was a sweet-tempered,
affectionate child, docile, gentle, and, excepting a little
occasional affectation and carelessness, very free from faults;
but now her attention could hardly be commanded for five minutes
together; she had lost the habit of ready and implicit obedience,
was petulant when reproved, and was far more eager to attract
notice from strangers&mdash;more conceited, and, therefore, more
affected, and, worse than all, Lily sometimes thought she
perceived a little slyness, though she was never able to prove
any one instance completely to herself, much less to bring one
before her father.&nbsp; Thus, if Ada had done any mischief, she
would indeed confess it on being examined; but when asked why she
had not told of it directly, would say she had forgotten; she
would avail herself of Phyllis&rsquo;s assistance in her lessons
without acknowledging it, and Lilias found it was by no means
safe to leave the Key to the French Exercises alone in the room
with her.</p>
<p>Emily&rsquo;s mismanagement had fostered Ada&rsquo;s
carelessness and inattention.&nbsp; Lady Rotherwood&rsquo;s
injudicious caresses helped to make her more affected; other
faults had grown up for want of sufficient control, but this last
was principally Esther&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Esther had done well
at school; she liked learning, was stimulated by notice, was
really attached to Lilias, and tried to deserve her goodwill; but
her training at school and at home were so different, that her
conduct was, even at the best, far too much of eye-service, and
she had very little idea of real truth and sincerity.</p>
<p>On first coming to the New Court she flattered the children,
because she did not know how to talk to them otherwise, and
afterwards, because she found that Miss Ada&rsquo;s affections
were to be gained by praise.&nbsp; Then, in her ignorant
good-nature, she had no scruples about concealing mischief which
the children had done, or procuring for Ada little forbidden
indulgences on her promise of secrecy, a promise which Phyllis
would not give, thus putting a stop to all those in which she
would have participated.&nbsp; It was no wonder that Ada,
sometimes helping Esther to deceive, sometimes deceived by her,
should have learnt the same kind of cunning, and ceased to think
it a matter of course to be true and just in all her
dealings.</p>
<p>But how was it that Phyllis remained the same &lsquo;honest
Phyl&rsquo; that she had ever been, not one word savouring of
aught but strict truth having ever crossed her lips, her thoughts
and deeds full of guileless simplicity?&nbsp; She met with the
same temptations, the same neglect, the same bad example, as her
sister; why had they no effect upon her?&nbsp; In the first
place, flattery could not touch her, it was like water on a
duck&rsquo;s back, she did not know that it was flattery, but so
thoroughly humble was her mind that no words of Esther&rsquo;s
would make her believe herself beautiful, agreeable, or
clever.&nbsp; Yet she never found out that Esther over-praised
her sister; she admired Ada so much that she never suspected that
any commendation of her was more than she deserved.&nbsp; Again,
Phyllis never thought of making herself appear to advantage, and
her humility saved her from the habit of concealing small faults,
for which she expected no punishment; and, when seriously to
blame, punishment seemed so natural a consequence, that she never
thought of avoiding it, otherwise than by expressing sorrow for
her fault.&nbsp; She was uninfected by Esther&rsquo;s deceit,
though she never suspected any want of truth; her singleness of
mind was a shield from all evil; she knew she was no favourite in
the nursery, but she never expected to be liked as much as Ada,
her pride and glory.&nbsp; In the meantime Emily went on
contriving opportunities and excuses for spending her time at
Devereux Castle, letting everything fall into Lily&rsquo;s hands,
everything that she had so eagerly undertaken little more than a
year ago.&nbsp; And now all was confusion; the excellent order in
which Eleanor had left the household affairs was quite
destroyed.&nbsp; Attention to the storeroom was one of the ways
in which Lilias thought that she could best follow the advice of
Mr. Devereux, since Eleanor had always taught that great
exactness in this point was most necessary.&nbsp; Great disorder
now, however, prevailed there, and she found that her only chance
of rectifying it was to measure everything she found there, and
to beg Emily to allow her to keep the key; for, when several
persons went to the storeroom, no one ever knew what was given
out, and she was sure that the sweet things diminished much
faster than they ought to do; but her sister treated the proposal
as an attempt to deprive her of her dignity, and she was
silenced.</p>
<p>She was up almost with the light, to despatch whatever
household affairs could be settled without Emily, before the time
came for the children&rsquo;s lessons; many hours were spent on
these, while she was continually harassed by Phyllis&rsquo;s
dulness, Ada&rsquo;s inattention, and the interruption of work to
do for Emily, and often was she baffled by interference from Jane
or Emily.&nbsp; She was conscious of her unfitness to teach the
children, and often saw that her impatience, ignorance, and
inefficiency, were doing mischief; but much as this pained her,
she could not speak to her father without compromising her
sister, and to argue with Emily herself was quite in vain.&nbsp;
Emily had taken up the principle of love, and defended herself
with it on every occasion, so that poor Lily was continually
punished by having her past follies quoted against herself.</p>
<p>Each day Emily grew more selfish and indolent; now that Lily
was willing to supply all that she neglected, and to do all that
she asked, she proved how tyrannical the weak can be.</p>
<p>The whole of her quarter&rsquo;s allowance was spent in dress,
and Lily soon found that the only chance of keeping her out of
debt was to spend her own time and labour in her behalf; and what
an exertion of patience and kindness this required can hardly be
imagined.&nbsp; Emily did indeed reward her skill with
affectionate thanks and kind praises, but she interfered with her
sleep and exercise, by her want of consideration, and hardened
herself more and more in her apathetic selfishness.</p>
<p>Some weeks after Easter Lilias was arranging some books on a
shelf in the schoolroom, when she met with a crumpled piece of
music-paper, squeezed in behind the books.&nbsp; It proved to be
Miss Weston&rsquo;s lost song, creased, torn, dust-stained, and
spoiled; she carried it to Emily, who decided that nothing could
be done but to copy it for Alethea, and apologise for the
disaster.&nbsp; Framing apologies was more in Emily&rsquo;s way
than copying music; and the former task, therefore, devolved upon
Lily, and occupied her all one afternoon, when she ought to have
been seeking a cure for the headache in the fresh air.&nbsp; It
was no cure to find the name of Emma Weston in the corner, and to
perceive how great and irreparable the loss of the paper was to
her friend.&nbsp; The thought of all her wrongs towards Alethea,
caused more than one large tear to fall, to blot the heads of her
crotchets and quavers, and thus give her all her work to do over
again.</p>
<p>The letter that she wrote was so melancholy and repentant,
that it gave great pain to her kind friend, who thought illness
alone could account for the dejection apparent in the general
tone of all her expressions.&nbsp; In answer, she sent a very
affectionate consoling letter, begging Lily to think no more of
the matter; and though she had too much regard for truth to say
that she had not been grieved by the loss of Emma&rsquo;s
writing, she added that Lily&rsquo;s distress gave her far more
pain, and that her copy would have great value in her eyes.</p>
<p>The beginning of June now arrived, and brought with it the
time for the return of Claude and Lord Rotherwood.</p>
<p>The Marquis&rsquo;s carriage met him at Raynham, and he set
down Claude at New Court, on his way to Hetherington, just coming
in to exchange a hurried greeting with the young ladies.</p>
<p>Their attention was principally taken up by their brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Claude, how well you look!&nbsp; How fat you
are!&rsquo; was their exclamation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is not he?&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am quite proud of him.&nbsp; Not one headache since he
went.&nbsp; He will have no excuse for not dancing the
polka.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not return the compliment to you, Lily,&rsquo;
said Claude, looking anxiously at his sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
is the matter with you?&nbsp; Have you been ill?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no! not at all!&rsquo; said Lily, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure there is enough to make any one ill,&rsquo;
said Emily, in her deplorable tone; &lsquo;I thought this poor
parish had had its share of illness, with the scarlet fever, and
now it has turned to a horrible typhus fever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where?&nbsp;
Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! the Naylors, and the Rays, and the Walls.&nbsp;
John Ray died this morning, and they do not think that Tom Naylor
will live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; interrupted Lord Rotherwood, &lsquo;I
shall not stop to hear any more of this chapter of
accidents.&nbsp; I am off, but mind, remember the 30th, and do
not any of you frighten yourselves into the fever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went, and Lily now spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is one thing
in all this, Claude, that is matter of joy, Tom Naylor has sent
for Robert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, Lily, I do most heartily congratulate
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope things may go better,&rsquo; said Lily, with
tears in her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;The poor baby is with its
grandmother.&nbsp; Mrs. Naylor is ill too, and every one is so
afraid of the fever that nobody goes near them but Robert, and
Mrs. Eden, and old Dame Martin.&nbsp; Robert says Naylor is in a
satisfactory frame&mdash;determined on having the baby
christened&mdash;but, oh! I am afraid the christening is to be
bought by something terrible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think those fevers are often very
infectious,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So papa says,&rsquo; replied Emily; &lsquo;but Robert
looks very ill.&nbsp; He is wearing himself out with sitting
up.&nbsp; Making himself nurse as well as everything
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was very distressing, but still Claude scarcely thought
it accounted for the change that had taken place in Lilias.&nbsp;
Her cheek was pale, her eye heavy, her voice had lost its merry
tone; Claude knew that she had had much to grieve her, but he was
as yet far from suspecting how she was overworked and
harassed.&nbsp; He spoke of Eleanor&rsquo;s return, and she did
not brighten; she smiled sadly at his attempts to cheer her, and
he became more and more anxious about her.&nbsp; He was not long
in discovering what was the matter.</p>
<p>The second day after his return Robert told them at the
churchyard gate that Tom Naylor was beginning to mend, and this
seemed to be a great comfort to Lily, who walked home with a
blither step than usual.&nbsp; Claude betook himself to the
study, and saw no more of his sisters till two o&rsquo;clock,
when Lily appeared, with the languid, dejected look which she had
lately worn, and seemed to find it quite an effort to keep the
tears out of her eyes.&nbsp; Ada and Phyllis were in very high
spirits, because they were going to Raynham with Emily and Jane,
and at every speech of Ada&rsquo;s Lily looked more
grieved.&nbsp; After the Raynham party were gone Claude began to
look for Lily.&nbsp; He found her in her room, an evening dress
spread on the bed, a roll of ribbon in one hand, and with the
other supporting her forehead, while tears were slowly rolling
down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lily, my dear, what is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! nothing, nothing, Claude,&rsquo; said she,
quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing! no, that is not true.&nbsp; Tell me,
Lily.&nbsp; You have been disconsolate ever since I came home,
and I will not let it go on so.&nbsp; No answer?&nbsp; Then am I
to suppose that these new pearlins are the cause of her
sorrow?&nbsp; Come, Lily, be like yourself, and speak.&nbsp; More
tears!&nbsp; Here, drink this water, be yourself again, or I
shall be angry and vexed.&nbsp; Now then, that is right: make an
effort, and tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is nothing to tell,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;only
you are very kind&mdash;I do not know what is the matter with
me&mdash;only I have been very foolish of late&mdash;and
everything makes me cry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor child, I knew you had not been well.&nbsp; They
do not know how to take care of you, Lily, and I shall take you
in hand.&nbsp; I am going to order the horses, and we will have a
gallop over the Downs, and put a little colour into your
cheeks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, thank you, Claude, I cannot come, indeed I
cannot, I have this work, which must be done to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At work at your finery instead of coming out!&nbsp; You
must be altered, indeed, Lily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not for myself,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;but I
promised Emily she should have it ready to wear
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily, oh?&nbsp; So she is making a slave of
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, it was a voluntary promise.&nbsp; She does not
care about it, only she would be disappointed, and I have
promised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate promises!&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
what must be, must be, so I will resign myself to this promise of
yours, only do not make such another.&nbsp; Well, but that was
not all; you were not crying about that fine green thing, were
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; said Lily, smiling, as now she could
smile again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What then?&nbsp; I will know, Lily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was only vexed at something about the
children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what was it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was only that Ada was idle at her lessons; I told
her to learn a verb as a punishment, she went to Emily, and,
somehow or other, Emily did not find out the exact facts, excused
her, and took her to Raynham.&nbsp; I was vexed, because I am
sure it does Ada harm, and Emily did not understand what I said
afterwards; I am sure she thought me unjust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How came she not to be present?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily does not often sit in the schoolroom in the
morning, since she has been about that large drawing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you are governess as well as ladies&rsquo;-maid, are
you, Lily?&nbsp; What else?&nbsp; Housekeeper, I suppose, as I
see you have all the weekly bills on your desk.&nbsp; Why, Lily,
this is perfectly philanthropic of you.&nbsp; You are
exemplifying the rule of love in a majestic manner.&nbsp; Crying
again!&nbsp; Water lily once more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily looked up, and smiled; &lsquo;Claude, how can you talk of
that old, silly, nay, wicked nonsense of my principle.&nbsp; I
was wise above what was written, and I have my punishment in the
wreck which my &ldquo;frenzy of spirit and folly of tongue&rdquo;
have wrought.&nbsp; The unchristened child, Agnes&rsquo;s death,
the confusion of this house, all are owing to my hateful
principle.&nbsp; I see the folly of it now, but Emily has taken
it up, and acts upon it in everything.&nbsp; I do struggle
against it a little; but I cannot blame any one, I can do no
good, it is all owing to me.&nbsp; We have betrayed papa&rsquo;s
confidence; if he does not see it now it will all come upon him
when Eleanor comes home, and what is to become of us?&nbsp; How
it will grieve him to see that we cannot be trusted!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Lily!&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a bad
prospect, but I think you see the worst side of it.&nbsp; You are
not well, and, therefore, doleful.&nbsp; This, Lily, I can tell
you, that the Baron always considered Emily&rsquo;s government as
a kind of experiment, and so perhaps he will not be so grievously
disappointed as you expect.&nbsp; Besides, I have a strong
suspicion that Emily&rsquo;s own nature has quite as much to do
with her present conduct as your principle, which, after all, did
not live very long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just long enough to unsettle me, and make it more
difficult for me to get any way right,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh! dear, what would I give to force backward the wheels
of time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But as you cannot, you had better try to brighten up
your energies.&nbsp; Come, you know I cannot tell you not to look
back, but I can tell you not to look forward.&nbsp; Nay, I do
tell you literally, to look forward, out of the window, instead
of back into this hot room.&nbsp; Do not you think the plane-tree
there looks very inviting?&nbsp; Suppose we transport
Emily&rsquo;s drapery there, and I want to refresh my memory with
Spenser; I do not think I have touched him since plane-tree time
last year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe Spenser and the plane-tree are inseparably
woven together in your mind,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ever since the time when I first met with the
book.&nbsp; I remember well roving over the bookcase, and meeting
with it, and taking it out there, for fear Eleanor should see me
and tell mama.&nbsp; Phyl, with <i>As You Like It</i>, put me
much in mind of myself with that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude talked in this manner, while Lily, listening with a
smile, prepared her work.&nbsp; He read, and she listened.&nbsp;
It was such a treat as she had not enjoyed for a long time, for
she had begun to think that all her pleasant reading days were
past.&nbsp; Her work prospered, and her face was bright when her
sisters came home.</p>
<p>But, alas!&nbsp; Emily was not pleased with her performance;
she said that she intended something quite different, and by
manner, rather than by words, indicated that she should not be
satisfied unless Lily completely altered it.&nbsp; It was to be
worn at the castle the next evening, and Lily knew she should
have no time for it in the course of the day.&nbsp; Accordingly,
at half-past twelve, as Claude was going up to bed, he saw a
light under his sister&rsquo;s door, and knocked to ask the
cause.&nbsp; Lily was still at work upon the trimming, and very
angry he was, particularly when she begged him to take care not
to disturb Emily.&nbsp; At last, by threatening to awake her, for
the express purpose of giving her a scolding, he made Lily
promise to go to bed immediately, a promise which she, poor weary
creature, was very glad to make.</p>
<p>Claude now resolved to tell his father the state of things,
for he well knew that though it was easy to obtain a general
promise from Emily, it was likely to be of little effect in
preventing her from spurring her willing horse to death.</p>
<p>The next morning he rose in time to join his father in the
survey which he usually took of his fields before breakfast, and
immediately beginning on the subject on which he was anxious, he
gave a full account of his sister&rsquo;s proceedings.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In short,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;Emily and Ada torment
poor Lily every hour of her life; she bears it all as a sort of
penance, and how it is to end I cannot tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unless,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, smiling, &lsquo;as
Rotherwood would say, Jupiter will interfere.&nbsp; Well, Jupiter
has begun to take measures, and has asked Mrs. Weston to look out
for a governess.&nbsp; Eh!&nbsp; Claude?&rsquo; he continued,
after a pause, &lsquo;you set up your eyebrows, do you?&nbsp; You
think it will be a bore.&nbsp; Very likely, but there is nothing
else to be done.&nbsp; Jane is under no control, Phyllis running
wild, Ada worse managed than any child of my
acquaintance&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And poor Lily wearing herself to a shadow, in vain
attempts to mend matters,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Lily was the eldest, things would be very
different,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or even if she had been as wise last year as she is
now,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;she would have kept Emily in
order then, but now it is too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This year is, on many accounts, much to be
regretted,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;but I think it has
brought out Lily&rsquo;s character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a very fine character it is,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very.&nbsp; She has been, and is, more childish than
Eleanor ever was, but she is her superior in most points.&nbsp;
She has been your pupil, Claude, and she does you
credit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thereby hangs a tale which does me no credit,&rsquo;
muttered Claude, as he remembered how foolishly he had roused her
spirit of contradiction, besides the original mischief of naming
Eleanor the duenna; &lsquo;but we will not enter into that
now.&nbsp; I see this governess is their best chance.&nbsp; Have
you heard of one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of several; but the only one who seems likely to suit
us is out of reach for the present, and I do not regret it, for I
shall not decide till Eleanor comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily will not be much pleased,&rsquo; said
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;It has long been her great dread that Aunt
Rotherwood should recommend one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, Emily&rsquo;s objections and your aunt&rsquo;s
recommendations are what I would gladly avoid,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Lily!&rsquo; said Claude, returning to the subject
on which he was most anxious.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is already what
Ada calls a monotony, and there will be nothing left of her by
the time Eleanor comes, if matters go on in their present
fashion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a plan for her.&nbsp; A little change will set
her to rights, and we will take her to London when we go next
week to meet Eleanor.&nbsp; She deserves a little extra pleasure;
you must take her under your protection, and lionise her
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trust me for that,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is the best news I have heard for a long time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am glad that one of my remedies meets with your
approbation,&rsquo; said his father, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;For
the other, you are much inclined to pronounce the cure as bad as
the disease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not for Lily,&rsquo; said Claude, laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;I think I can
promise you that a remedy will be found for all the other
grievances by Michaelmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude looked surprised, but as Mr. Mohun explained no
further, only observing upon the potatoes, through which they
were walking, he only said, &lsquo;Then it is next week that you
go to London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is much to do, both for Rotherwood and for
Eleanor; I shall go as soon as I can, but I do not think it will
be while this fever is so prevalent.&nbsp; I had rather not be
from home&mdash;I do not like Robert&rsquo;s looks.&rsquo;</p>

222</span>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE RECTOR&rsquo;S ILLNESS</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thou drooping sick man, bless the guide<br
/>
That checked, or turned thy headstrong youth.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> thought of her brother&rsquo;s
kindness, and the effect of his consolation, made Lilias awake
that morning in more cheerful spirits; but it was not long before
grief and anxiety again took possession of her.</p>
<p>The first sound that she heard on opening the schoolroom
window was the tolling of the church bell, giving notice of the
death of another of those to whom she felt bound by the ties of
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>At church she saw that Mr. Devereux was looking more ill than
he yet had done, and it was plainly with very great exertion that
he succeeded in finishing the service.&nbsp; The Mohun party
waited, as usual, to speak to him afterwards, for since his
attendance upon Naylor had begun he had not thought it safe to
come to the New Court as usual, lest he should bring the
infection to them.&nbsp; He was very pale, and walked wearily,
but he spoke cheerfully, as he told them that Naylor was now
quite out of danger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I hope you did not stay there all last
night,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I did not, I was so tired when I came back from
poor John Ray&rsquo;s funeral, that I thought I would take a
holiday, and sleep at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you have not profited by your night&rsquo;s
rest,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;you look as if you had a horrible
headache.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;I prescribe for you
that you go home and lie down.&nbsp; I am going to Raynham, and I
will tell your friend there that you want help for the evening
service.&nbsp; Do not think of moving again to-day.&nbsp; I shall
send Claude home with you to see that you obey my
prescription.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude went home with his cousin, and his sisters saw him no
more till late in the day, when he came to tell them that Mr.
Mohun had brought back Dr. Leslie from Raynham with him, that Dr.
Leslie had seen Mr. Devereux, and had pronounced that he had
certainly caught the fever.</p>
<p>Lily had made up her mind to this for some time, but still it
seemed almost as great a blow as if it had come without any
preparation.&nbsp; The next day was the first Sunday that Mr.
Devereux had not read the service since he had been Rector of
Beechcroft.&nbsp; The villagers looked sadly at the stranger who
appeared in his place, and many tears were shed when the prayers
of the congregation were desired for Robert Devereux, and Thomas
and Martha Naylor.&nbsp; It was announced that the daily service
would be discontinued for the present, and Lily felt as if all
the blessings which she had misused were to be taken from
her.</p>
<p>For some time Mr. Devereux continued very ill, and Dr. Leslie
gave little hope of his improvement.&nbsp; Mr. Mohun and Claude
were his constant attendants&mdash;an additional cause of anxiety
to the Miss Mohuns.&nbsp; Emily was listless and melancholy,
talking in a maundering, dismal way, not calculated to brace her
spirits or those of her sisters.&nbsp; Jane was not without
serious thoughts, but whether they would benefit her depended on
herself; for, as we have seen by the events of the autumn, sorrow
and suffering do not necessarily produce good effects, though
some effects they always produce.</p>
<p>Thus it was with Lilias.&nbsp; Grief and anxiety aided her in
subduing her will and learning resignation.&nbsp; She did not
neglect her daily duties, but was more exact in their fulfilment;
and low as her spirits had been before, she now had an inward
spring which enabled her to be the support of the rest.&nbsp; She
was useful to her father, always ready to talk to Claude, or walk
with him in the intervals when he was sent out of the sickroom to
rest and breathe the fresh air.&nbsp; She was cheerful and
patient with Emily, and devoid of petulance when annoyed by the
spirits of the younger ones rising higher than accorded with the
sad and anxious hearts of their elders.&nbsp; Her most painful
feeling was, that it was possible that she might be punished
through her cousin, as she had already been through Agnes; that
her follies might have brought this distress upon every one, and
that this was the price at which the child&rsquo;s baptism was to
be bought.&nbsp; Yet Lily would not have changed her present
thoughts for any of her varying frames of mind since that fatal
Whitsuntide.&nbsp; Better feelings were springing up within her
than she had then known; the church service and Sunday were
infinitely more to her, and she was beginning to obtain peace of
mind independent of external things.</p>
<p>She could not help rejoicing to see how many evidences of
affection to the Rector were called forth by this illness;
presents of fruit poured in from all quarters, from Lord
Rotherwood&rsquo;s choice hothouse grapes, to poor little Kezia
Grey&rsquo;s wood-strawberries; inquiries were continual, and the
stillness of the village was wonderful.&nbsp; There was no
cricket on the hill, no talking in the street, no hallooing in
the hay-field, and no burst of noise when the children were let
out of school.&nbsp; Many of the people were themselves in grief
for the loss of their own relations; and when on Sunday the Miss
Mohuns saw how many were dressed in black, they thought with a
pang how soon they themselves might be mourning for one whose
influence they had crippled, and whose plans they had thwarted
during the three short years of his ministry.</p>
<p>During this time it was hard to say whether Lord Rotherwood
was more of a comfort or a torment.&nbsp; He was attached to his
cousin with all the ardour of his affectionate disposition, and
not one day passed without his appearing at Beechcroft.&nbsp; At
first it was always in the parlour at the parsonage that he took
up his station, and waited till he could find some means of
getting at Claude or his uncle, to hear the last report from
them, and if possible to make Claude come out for a walk or ride
with him.&nbsp; And once Mr. Mohun caught him standing just
outside Mr. Devereux&rsquo;s door, waiting for an opportunity to
make an entrance.&nbsp; He could not, or would not see why Mr.
Mohun should allow Claude to run the risk of infection rather
than himself, and thus he kept his mother in continual anxiety,
and even his uncle could not feel by any means certain that he
would not do something imprudent.&nbsp; At last a promise was
extracted from him that he would not again enter the parsonage,
but he would not gratify Lady Rotherwood so far as to abstain
from going to Beechcroft, a place which she began to regard with
horror.&nbsp; He now was almost constantly at the New Court,
talking over the reports, and quite provoking Emily by never
desponding, and never choosing to perceive how bad things really
were.&nbsp; Every day which was worse than the last was supposed
to be the crisis, and every restless sleep that they heard of he
interpreted into the beginning of recovery.&nbsp; At last,
however, after ten days of suspense, the report began to improve,
and Claude came to the New Court with a more cheerful face, to
say that his cousin was munch better.&nbsp; The world seemed
immediately to grow brighter, people went about with joyful
looks, Lord Rotherwood declared that from the first he had known
all would be well, and Lily began to hope that now she had been
spared so heavy a punishment, it was a kind of earnest that other
things would mend, that she had suffered enough.&nbsp; The future
no longer hung before her in such dark colours as before Mr.
Devereux&rsquo;s illness, though still the New Court was in no
satisfactory state, and still she had reason to expect that her
father and Eleanor would be disappointed and grieved.&nbsp;
Thankfulness that Mr. Devereux was recovering, and that Claude
had escaped the infection, made her once more hopeful and
cheerful; she let the morrow take thought for the things of
itself, rejoicing that it was not her business to make
arrangements.</p>
<h2><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE LITTLE NEPHEW</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You must be father, mother, both,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And uncle, all in one.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Mohun</span> had much business to
transact in London which he could not leave undone, and as soon
as his nephew began to recover he thought of setting off to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Hawkesworth, who had already been a week at Lady
Rotherwood&rsquo;s house in Grosvenor Square, which she had lent
to them for the occasion.&nbsp; Claude had intended to stay at
home, as his cousin was not yet well enough to leave the room;
but just at this time a college friend of the Rector&rsquo;s,
hearing of his illness, wrote to propose to come and stay with
him for a month or six weeks, and help him in serving his
church.&nbsp; Mr. Devereux was particularly glad to accept this
kind offer, as it left him no longer dependent on Mr. Stephens
and the Raynham curates, and set Claude at liberty for the London
expedition.&nbsp; All was settled in the short space of one
day.&nbsp; The very next they were to set off, and in great
haste; Lily did all she could for the regulation of the house,
packed up her goods, and received the commissions of her
sisters.</p>
<p>Ada gave her six shillings, with orders to buy either a doll
or a book&mdash;the former if Eleanor did not say it was silly;
and Phyllis put into her hands a weighty crown piece, begging for
as many things as it could buy.&nbsp; Jane&rsquo;s wants and
wishes were moderate and sensible, and she gave Lily the money
for them.&nbsp; With Emily there was more difficulty.&nbsp; All
Lily&rsquo;s efforts had not availed to prevent her from
contracting two debts at Raynham.&nbsp; More than four pounds she
owed to Lily, and this she offered to pay her, giving her at the
same time a list of commissions sufficient to swallow up double
her quarter&rsquo;s allowance.&nbsp; Lily, though really in want
of the money for her own use, thought the debts at Raynham so
serious, that she begged Emily to let her wait for payment till
it was convenient, and to pay the shoemaker and dressmaker
immediately.</p>
<p>Emily thanked her, and promised to do so as soon as she could
go to Raynham, and Lily next attempted to reduce her list of
London commissions to something more reasonable.&nbsp; In part
she succeeded, but it remained a matter of speculation how all
the necessary articles which she had to buy for herself, and all
Emily&rsquo;s various orders, were to come out of her own means,
reduced as they were by former loans.</p>
<p>The next day Lilias was on her way to London; feeling, as she
left Beechcroft, that it was a great relief that the schoolroom
and storeroom could not follow her.&nbsp; She was sorry that she
should miss seeing Alethea Weston, who was to come home the next
day, but she left various messages for her, and an affectionate
note, and had received a promise from her sisters that the copy
of the music should be given to her the first day that they saw
her.&nbsp; Her journey afforded her much amusement, and it was
not till towards the end of the day that she had much time for
thinking, when, her companions being sleepily inclined, she was
left to her own meditations and to a dull country.&nbsp; She
began to revolve her own feelings towards Eleanor, and as she
remembered the contempt and ingratitude she had once expressed,
she shrank from the meeting with shame and dread, and knew that
she should feel reproached by Eleanor&rsquo;s wonted calmness of
manner.&nbsp; And as she mused upon all that Eleanor had endured,
and all that she had done, such a reverence for suffering and
sacrifice took possession of her mind that she was ready to look
up to her sister with awe.&nbsp; She began to recollect old
reproofs, and found herself sitting more upright, and examining
the sit of the folds of her dress with some uneasiness at the
thought of Eleanor&rsquo;s preciseness.&nbsp; In the midst of her
meditations her two companions were roused by the slackening
speed of the train, and starting up, informed her that they were
arriving at their journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; The next minute she
heard her father consigning her and the umbrellas to Mr.
Hawkesworth&rsquo;s care, and all was bewilderment till she found
herself in the hall of her aunt&rsquo;s house, receiving as warm
and affectionate a greeting from Eleanor as Emily herself could
have bestowed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the baby, Eleanor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Asleep, but you shall see him; and how is Ada? and all
of them? why, Claude, how well you look!&nbsp; Papa, let me help
you to take off your greatcoat&mdash;you are cold&mdash;will you
have a fire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Never had Lily heard Eleanor say so much in a breath, or seen
her eye so bright, or her smile so ready, yet, when she entered
the drawing-room, she saw that Mrs. Hawkesworth was still the
Eleanor of old.&nbsp; In contrast with the splendid furniture of
the apartments, a pile of shirts was on the table,
Eleanor&rsquo;s well-known work-basket on the floor, and the
ceaseless knitting close at hand.</p>
<p>Much news was exchanged in the few minutes that elapsed before
Eleanor carried off her sister to her room, indulging her by the
way with a peep at little Harry, and one kiss to his round red
cheek as he lay asleep in his little bed.&nbsp; It was not
Eleanor&rsquo;s fault that she did not entirely dress Lily, and
unpack her wardrobe; but Lilias liked to show that she could
manage for herself; and Eleanor&rsquo;s praise of her neat
arrangements gave her as much pleasure as in days of yore.</p>
<p>The evening passed very happily.&nbsp; Eleanor&rsquo;s heart
was open, she was full of enjoyment at meeting those she loved,
and the two sisters sat long together in the twilight, talking
over numerous subjects, all ending in Beechcroft or the baby.</p>
<p>Yet when Lily awoke the next morning her awe of Eleanor began
to return, and she felt like a child just returned to
school.&nbsp; She was, however, mistaken; Eleanor assumed no
authority, she treated Lily as her equal, and thus made her feel
more like a woman than she had ever done before.&nbsp; Lily
thought either that Eleanor was much altered, or that in her
folly she must have fancied her far more cold and grave than she
really was.&nbsp; She had, however, no time for studying her
character; shopping and sight-seeing filled up most of her time,
and the remainder was spent in resting, and in playing with
little Henry.</p>
<p>One evening, when Mr. Mohun and Claude were dining out, Lilias
was left alone with Mr. and Mrs. Hawkesworth.&nbsp; Lily was very
tired, but she worked steadily at marking Eleanor&rsquo;s
pocket-handkerchiefs, until her sister, seeing how weary she was,
made her lie down on the sofa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is a gentleman who is tired too,&rsquo; said
Eleanor, dancing the baby; &lsquo;we will carry you off, sir, and
leave Aunt Lily to go to sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aunt Lily is not so tired as that,&rsquo; said Lily;
&lsquo;pray keep him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is quite bedtime,&rsquo; said Eleanor, in her
decided tone, and she carried him off.</p>
<p>Lilias took up the knitting which she had laid down, and began
to study the stitches.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should like this feathery
pattern,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;(if it did not remind me so much
of the fever); but, by the bye, Frank, have you completed Master
Henry&rsquo;s outfit?&nbsp; I looked forward to helping to choose
his pretty little things, but I see no preparation but of
stockings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Lily, did not you know that he was to stay in
England?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To stay in England?&nbsp; No, I never thought of
that&mdash;how sorry you must be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Eleanor returned, and Mr. Hawkesworth told her
he had been surprised to find Lily did not know their intentions
with regard to the baby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we had any certain intentions we should have told
her,&rsquo; said Eleanor; &lsquo;I did not wish to speak to her
about it till we had made up our minds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I know no use in mysteries,&rsquo; said Mr.
Hawkesworth, &lsquo;especially when Lily may help us to
decide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On his going or staying?&rsquo; exclaimed Lily, eagerly
looking to Mr. Hawkesworth, who was evidently more disposed to
speak than his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not on his going or staying&mdash;I am sorry to say
that point was settled long ago&mdash;but where we shall leave
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily&rsquo;s heart beat high, but she did not speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The truth is,&rsquo; proceeded Mr. Hawkesworth,
&lsquo;that this young gentleman has, as perhaps you know, a
grandpapa, a grandmamma, and also six or seven aunts.&nbsp; With
his grandmamma he cannot be left, for sundry reasons, unnecessary
to mention.&nbsp; Now, one of his aunts is a staid matronly lady,
and his godmother besides, and in all respects the person to take
charge of him,&mdash;only she lives in a small house in a town,
and has plenty of babies of her own, without being troubled with
other people&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Master Henry&rsquo;s other five aunts
live in one great house, in a delightful country, with nothing to
do but make much of him all day long, yet it is averred that
these said aunts are a parcel of giddy young colts, amongst whom,
if Henry escapes being demolished as a baby he will infallibly be
spoilt as he grows up.&nbsp; Now, how are we to
decide?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have heard the true state of the case, Lily,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Hawkesworth.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did not wish to harass papa
by speaking to him till something was settled; you are certainly
old enough to have an opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Lily,&rsquo; said Frank; &lsquo;do you think that
the hospitable New Court will open to receive our poor deserted
child, and that these said aunts are not wild colts but discreet
damsels?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Playful as Mr. Hawkesworth&rsquo;s manner was, Lily saw the
earnestness that was veiled under it: she felt the solemnity of
Eleanor&rsquo;s appeal, and knew that this was no time to let
herself be swayed by her wishes.&nbsp; There was a silence.&nbsp;
At last, after a great struggle, Lily&rsquo;s better judgment
gained the mastery, and raising her head, she said,
&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Frank, do not ask me&mdash;I wish&mdash;but,
Eleanor, when you see how much harm we have done, how utterly we
have failed&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily&rsquo;s newly-acquired habits of self-command enabled her
to subdue a violent fit of sobbing, which she felt impending, but
her tears flowed quietly down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Remember,&rsquo; said Frank, &lsquo;those who mistrust
themselves are the most trustworthy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Frank, it is not only the feeling of the greatness
of the charge, it is the knowledge that we are not fit for
it&mdash;that our own faults have forfeited such
happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again Lily was choked with tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Frank, &lsquo;we shall judge at
Beechcroft.&nbsp; At all events, one of those aunts is to be
respected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor added her &lsquo;Very right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This kindness on the part of her brother-in-law, which Lily
felt to be undeserved, caused her tears to flow faster, and
Eleanor, seeing her quite overcome, led her out of the room,
helped her to undress, and put her to bed, with tenderness such
as Lily had never experienced from her, excepting in illness.</p>
<p>In spite of bitter regrets, when she thought of the happiness
it would have been to keep her little nephew, and of importunate
and disappointing hopes that Mrs. Ridley would find it impossible
to receive him, Lily felt that she had done right, and had made a
real sacrifice for duty&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; No more was said on
the subject, and Lily was very grateful to Eleanor for making no
inquiries, which she could not have answered without blaming
Emily.</p>
<p>Sight-seeing prospered very well under Claude&rsquo;s
guidance, and Lily&rsquo;s wonder and delight was a constant
source of amusement to her friends.&nbsp; Her shopping was more
of a care than a pleasure, for, in spite of the handsome
equipments which Mr. Mohun presented to all his daughters, it was
impossible to contract Emily&rsquo;s requirements within the
limits of what ought to be her expenditure, and the different
views of her brother and sister were rather troublesome in this
matter.&nbsp; Claude hated the search for ladies&rsquo; finery,
and if drawn into it, insisted on always taking her to the
grandest and most expensive shops; while, on the other hand,
though Eleanor liked to hunt up cheap things and good bargains,
she had such rigid ideas about plainness of dress, that there was
little chance that what she approved would satisfy Emily.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Suddenly, a mighty jerk<br />
A mighty mischief did.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the meantime Emily and Jane went
on very prosperously at home, looking forward to the return of
the rest of the party on Saturday, the 17th of July.&nbsp; In
this, however, they were doomed to disappointment, for neither
Mr. Mohun nor Mr. Hawkesworth could wind up their affairs so as
to return before the 24th.&nbsp; Maurice&rsquo;s holidays
commenced on Monday the 19th, and Claude offered to go home on
the same day, and meet him, but in a general council it was
determined to the contrary.&nbsp; Claude was wanted to stay for a
concert on Thursday, and both Mr. Mohun and Eleanor thought
Maurice, without Reginald, would not be formidable for a few
days.</p>
<p>At first he seemed to justify this opinion.&nbsp; He did not
appear to have any peculiar pursuit, unless such might be called
a very earnest attempt to make Phyllis desist from her favourite
preface of &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; and to reform
her habit of saying, &lsquo;Please for,&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;If you please.&rsquo;&nbsp; He walked with the sisters,
carried messages for Mr. Devereux, performed some neat little
bits of carpentry, and was very useful and agreeable.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon Lord Rotherwood and Florence called,
their heads the more full of the 30th because the Marquis had not
once thought of it while Mr. Devereux was ill.&nbsp; Among the
intended diversions fireworks were mentioned, and from that
moment rockets, wheels, and serpents, commenced a wild career
through Maurice&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; Through the whole evening he
searched for books on what he was pleased to call the art of
pyrotechnics, studied them all Wednesday, and the next morning
announced his intention of making some fireworks on a new
plan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you must not,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;you will be
sure to do mischief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to ask Wat for some powder,&rsquo; was
Maurice&rsquo;s reply, and he walked off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop him, Jane, stop him,&rsquo; cried Emily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing can be so dangerous.&nbsp; Tell him how angry papa
would be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Jane highly esteemed her brother&rsquo;s discretion,
she did not much like the idea of his touching powder, and she
ran after him to suggest that he had better wait till
papa&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Redgie will be at home,&rsquo; said Maurice,
&lsquo;and I could not be answerable for the consequence of such
a careless fellow touching powder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This great proof of caution quite satisfied Jane, but not so
Wat Greenwood, who proved himself a faithful servant by refusing
to let Master Maurice have one grain of gunpowder without express
leave from the squire.&nbsp; Maurice then had recourse to Jane,
and his power over her was such as to triumph over strong sense
and weak notions of obedience, so that she was prevailed upon to
supply him with the means of making the dangerous and forbidden
purchase.</p>
<p>Emily was both annoyed and alarmed when she found that the
gunpowder was actually in the house, and she even thought of
sending a note to the parsonage to beg Mr. Devereux to speak to
Maurice; but Jane had gone over to the enemy, and Emily never
could do anything unsupported.&nbsp; Besides, she neither liked
to affront Maurice nor to confess herself unable to keep him in
order; and she, therefore, tried to put the whole matter out of
her head, in the thoughts of an expedition to Raynham, which she
was about to make in the manner she best liked, with Jane in the
close carriage, and the horses reluctantly spared from their farm
work.</p>
<p>As they were turning the corner of the lane they overtook
Phyllis and Adeline on their way to the school with some work,
and Emily stopped the carriage, to desire them to send off a
letter which she had left on the chimney-piece in the
schoolroom.&nbsp; Then proceeding to Raynham, they made their
visits, paid Emily&rsquo;s debts, performed their commissions,
and met the carriage again at the bookseller&rsquo;s shop, at the
end of about two hours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, Emily!&rsquo; exclaimed Jane.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Read this! can it be Mrs. Aylmer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The truly charitable,&rsquo; said Emily,
contemptuously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs. Aylmer is
above&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But read.&nbsp; It says &ldquo;unbeneficed clergyman
and deceased nobleman,&rdquo; and who can that be but Uncle
Rotherwood and Mr. Aylmer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, let us see,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;those
things are always amusing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was an appeal to the &lsquo;truly charitable,&rsquo; from
the friends of the widow of an unbeneficed clergyman of the
diocese, one of whose sons had, it was said, by the kindness of a
deceased nobleman, received the promise of an appointment in
India, of which he was unable to avail himself for want of the
funds needful for his outfit.&nbsp; This appeal was, it added,
made without the knowledge of the afflicted lady, but further
particulars might be learnt by application to E. F., No. 5 West
Street, Raynham.</p>
<p>&lsquo;E. F. is plainly that bustling, little, old Miss
Fitchett, who wrote to papa for some subscription,&rsquo; said
Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know she is a regular beggar, always
doing these kind of things, but I can never believe that Mrs.
Aylmer would consent to appear in this manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but it says without her knowledge,&rsquo; said
Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember Rotherwood&rsquo;s
lamenting that they were forgotten?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is shocking,&rsquo; said Emily; &lsquo;the
clergyman that married papa and mamma!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ask Mr. Adam what he knows,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>Emily accordingly applied to the bookseller, and learnt that
Mrs. Aylmer was indeed the person intended.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Something must be done,&rsquo; said she, returning to
Jane.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our name will be a help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak to Aunt Rotherwood,&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Or suppose we apply to Miss Fitchett, we should have time
to drive that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I shall not go to Miss Fitchett,&rsquo; said
Emily, &lsquo;she only longs for an excuse to visit us.&nbsp;
What can you be thinking of?&nbsp; Lend me your pencil, Jenny, if
you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Emily wrote down, &lsquo;Miss Mohun, &pound;5,&rsquo; and
handed to the bookseller all that she possessed towards paying
her just debts to Lilias.&nbsp; While she was writing, Jane had
turned towards the window, and suddenly exclaiming, &lsquo;There
is Ben!&nbsp; Oh! that gunpowder!&rsquo; darted out of the
shop.&nbsp; She had seen the groom on horseback, and the next
moment she was asking breathlessly, &lsquo;Is it
Maurice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Miss Jane; but Miss Ada is badly burnt, and Master
Maurice sent me to fetch Mr. Saunders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did it happen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say, Miss; the schoolroom has been on
fire, and Master Maurice said the young ladies had got at the
gunpowder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emily had just arrived at the door, looking dreadfully pale,
and followed by numerous kind offers of salts and glasses of
water; but Jane, perceiving that at least she had strength to get
into the carriage, refused them all, helped her in, and with
instant decision, desired to be driven to the
surgeon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Emily obeyed like a child, and threw
herself back in the carriage without a word; Jane trembled like
an aspen leaf; but her higher spirit took the lead, and very
sensibly she managed, stopping at Mr. Saunders&rsquo;s door to
offer to take him to Beechcroft, and getting a glass of
sal-volatile for Emily while they were waiting for him.&nbsp; His
presence was a great relief, for Emily&rsquo;s natural courtesy
made her exert herself, and thus warded off much that would have
been very distressing.</p>
<p>In the meantime we will return to Beechcroft, where
Emily&rsquo;s request respecting her letter had occasioned some
discussion between the little girls, as they returned from a walk
with Marianne.&nbsp; Phyllis thought that Emily meant them to
wafer the letter, since they were under strict orders never to
touch fire or candle; but Ada argued that they were to seal it,
and that permission to light a candle was implied in the
order.&nbsp; At last, Phyllis hoped the matter might be settled
by asking Maurice to seal the letter, and meeting him at the
front door, she began, in fortunately, with &lsquo;Please,
Maurice&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never listen to anything beginning with
please,&rsquo; said Maurice, who was in a great hurry,
&lsquo;only don&rsquo;t touch my powder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Away he went, deaf to all his sister&rsquo;s shouts of
&lsquo;Maurice, Maurice,&rsquo; and they went in, Ada not sorry
to be unheard, as she was bent on the grand exploit of lighting a
lucifer match, but Phyllis still pleading for the wafer.&nbsp;
They found the schoolroom strewed with Maurice&rsquo;s
preparations for fireworks, and Emily&rsquo;s letter on the
chimney-piece.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us take the letter downstairs, and put on a
wafer,&rsquo; said Phyllis.&nbsp; &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you come,
Ada?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, the stamps are here, and so are the matches, I can
do it easily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Ada, Ada, it would be naughty.&nbsp; Only wait, and
I will show you such a pretty wafer that I know of in the
drawing-room.&nbsp; I will run and fetch it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis went, and Ada stood a few moments in doubt, looking at
the letter.&nbsp; The recollection of duty was not strong enough
to balance the temptation, and she took up a match and drew it
along the sandpaper.&nbsp; It did not light&mdash;a second pull,
and the flame appeared more suddenly than she had expected, while
at the same moment the lock of the door turned, and fancying it
was Maurice, she started, and dropped the match.&nbsp; Phyllis
opened the door, heard a loud explosion and a scream, saw a
bright flash and a cloud of smoke.&nbsp; She started back, but
the next moment again opened the door, and ran forward.&nbsp;
Hannah rushed in at the same time, and caught up Ada, who had
fallen to the ground.&nbsp; A light in the midst of the smoke
made Phyllis turn, and she beheld the papers on the table on
fire.&nbsp; Maurice&rsquo;s powder-horn was in the midst, but the
flames had not yet reached it, and, mindful of Claude&rsquo;s
story, she sprung forward, caught it up, and dashed it through
the window; she felt the glow of the fire upon her cheek, and
stood still as if stunned, till Hannah carried Ada out of the
room, and screamed to her to come away, and call Joseph.&nbsp;
The table was now one sheet of flame, and Phyllis flew to the
pantry, where she gave the summons in almost inaudible
tones.&nbsp; The servants hurried to the spot, and she was left
alone and bewildered; she ran hither and thither in confusion,
till she met Hannah, eagerly asking for Master Maurice, and
saying that the surgeon must be instantly sent for, as
Ada&rsquo;s face and neck were badly burnt.&nbsp; Phyllis ran
down, calling Maurice, and at length met him at the front door,
looking much frightened, and asking for Ada.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Maurice, her face and neck are burnt, and
badly.&nbsp; She does scream?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I not tell you not to meddle with the
powder?&rsquo; said Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I could not help it,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stuff and nonsense!&nbsp; It is very well that you have
not killed Ada, and I think that would have made you
sorry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis with difficulty mentioned Hannah&rsquo;s desire that a
surgeon should be sent for: Maurice went to look for Ben, and she
followed him.&nbsp; Then he began asking how she had done the
mischief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I do not much
think I did it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind, you can&rsquo;t humbug me.&nbsp; Did you not say
that you touched the powder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No buts,&rsquo; said Maurice, making the most of his
brief authority.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hate false excuses.&nbsp; What
were you doing when it exploded?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coming into the room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that accounts for it,&rsquo; said Maurice,
&lsquo;the slightest vibration causes an explosion of that sort
of rocket, and of course it was your bouncing into the
room!&nbsp; You have had a lesson against rushing about the
house.&nbsp; Come, though, cheer up, Phyl, it is a bad business,
but it might have been worse; you will know better next
time.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t cry, Phyl, I will explain to you all
about the patent rocket.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But do you really think that I blew up Ada?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blew up Ada! caused the powder to ignite.&nbsp; The
inflammable matter&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he followed Phyllis to the nursery, and there was
so much shocked, that he could no longer lord it over her, but
shrinking back, shut himself up in his room, and bolted the
door.</p>
<p>Nearly an hour passed away before the arrival of Emily, Jane,
and Mr. Saunders.&nbsp; Phyllis ran down, and meeting them at the
door, exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh! Emily, poor Ada!&nbsp; I am so
sorry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sisters hurried past her to the nursery, where Ada was
lying on the bed, half undressed, and her face, neck, and arm
such a spectacle that Emily turned away, ready to faint.&nbsp;
Mr. Saunders was summoned, and Phyllis thrust out of the
room.&nbsp; She sat down on the step of the stairs, resting her
forehead on her knees, and trembling, listened to the sounds of
voices, and the screams which now and then reached her
ears.&nbsp; After a time she was startled by hearing herself
called from the stairs <i>by below</i> a voice which she had not
heard for many weeks, and springing up, saw Mr. Devereux leaning
on the banisters.&nbsp; The great change in his appearance
frightened her almost as much as the accident itself, and she
stood looking at him without speaking.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Phyllis,&rsquo; said he, in a voice hoarse with agitation,
&lsquo;what is it? tell me at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could not speak, and her wild and frightened air might
well give him great alarm.&nbsp; She pointed to the nursery, and
put her finger to her lips, and he, beckoning to her to follow
him, went downstairs, and turning into the drawing-room, said, as
he sank down upon the sofa, &lsquo;Now, Phyllis, what has
happened?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The gunpowder&mdash;I made it go off, and it has burnt
poor Ada&rsquo;s face!&nbsp; Mr. Saunders is there, and she
screams&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis finding herself ready to roar, left off speaking, and
laying her head on the table, burst into an agony of crying,
while Mr. Devereux was too much exhausted to address her; at last
she exclaimed: &lsquo;I hear the nursery door; he is
going!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She flew to the door, and listened, and then called out,
&lsquo;Emily, Jane, here is Cousin Robert!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane came down, leaving Emily to finish hearing Mr.
Saunders&rsquo;s directions.&nbsp; She was even more shocked at
her cousin&rsquo;s looks than Phyllis had been, and though she
tried to speak cheerfully, her manner scarcely agreed with her
words.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is all well, Robert, I am sorry you have
been so frightened.&nbsp; It is but a slight affair, though it
looks so shocking.&nbsp; There is no danger.&nbsp; But, oh,
Robert! you ought not to be here.&nbsp; What shall we do for you?
you are quite knocked up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! no,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux, &lsquo;I am only a
little out of breath.&nbsp; A terrible report came to me, and I
set off to learn the truth.&nbsp; I should like to hear what Mr.
Saunders says of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will call him in here before he goes,&rsquo; said
Jane; &lsquo;how tired you are; you have not been out
before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only to the gate to speak to Rotherwood yesterday, and
prevent him from coming in,&rsquo; said Mr. Devereux, &lsquo;but
I have great designs for Sunday.&nbsp; They come home to-morrow,
do not they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane was much relieved by hearing her cousin talk in this
manner, and answered, &lsquo;Yes, and a dismal coming home it
will be; it is too late to let them know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Saunders now entered, and gave a very favourable account
of the patient, saying that even the scars would probably
disappear in a few weeks.&nbsp; His gig had come from Raynham,
and he offered to set Mr. Devereux down at the parsonage, a
proposal which the latter was very glad to accept.&nbsp; Emily
and Jane had leisure, when they were gone, to inquire into the
manner of the accident.&nbsp; Phyllis answered that Maurice said
that her banging the door had made the powder go off.&nbsp; Jane
then asked where Maurice was, and Phyllis reporting that he was
in his own room, she repaired thither, and knocked twice without
receiving an answer.&nbsp; On her call, however, he opened the
door; she saw that he had been in tears, and hastened to tell him
Mr. Saunders&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; He fastened the door again as
soon as she had entered.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I could have thought
it!&rsquo; sighed he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fool that I was, not to lock
the door!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you were not there?&nbsp; Phyllis says that she
did it by banging the door.&nbsp; Is not that
nonsense?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; Did I not read to you in the <i>Year
Book of Facts</i> about the patent signal rockets, which explode
with the least vibration, even when a carriage goes by?&nbsp;
Now, mine was on the same principle.&nbsp; I was making an
experiment on the ingredients; I did not expect to succeed the
first time, and so I took no precautions.&nbsp; Well!
Pyrotechnics are a dangerous science!&nbsp; Next time I study
them it shall be at the workshop at the Old Court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maurice was sincerely sorry for the consequence of his
disobedience, and would have been much to be pitied had it not
been for his secret satisfaction in the success of his art.&nbsp;
He called his sister into the schoolroom to explain how it
happened.&nbsp; The room was a dismal sight, blackened with
smoke, and flooded with water, the table and part of the floor
charred, a mass of burnt paper in the midst, and a stifling smell
of fire.&nbsp; A pane of glass was shattered, and Maurice ran
down to the lawn to see if he could find anything there to
account for it.&nbsp; The next moment he returned, the
powder-horn in his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;See, Jenny, how fortunate
that this was driven through the window with the force of the
explosion.&nbsp; The whole place might have been blown to atoms
with such a quantity as this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what was it that blew up?&rsquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What I had put out for my rocket, about two
ounces.&nbsp; If this half-pound had gone there is no saying what
might have happened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Maurice,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;I must go back
to Ada, and will you run down to the parsonage with a parcel,
directed to Robert, that you will find in the hall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was a device to occupy Maurice, who, as Jane saw, was so
restless and unhappy that she did not like to leave him, much as
she was wanted elsewhere.&nbsp; He went, but afraid to see his
cousin, only left the parcel at the door.&nbsp; As he was going
back he heard a shout, and looking round saw Lord Rotherwood
mounted on Cedric, his most spirited horse, galloping up the
lane.&nbsp; &lsquo;Maurice!&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;what is all
this? they say the New Court is blown up, and you and half the
girls killed, but I hope one part is as true as the
other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody is hurt but Ada,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;but
her face is a good deal burnt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh? then she won&rsquo;t be fit for the 30th, poor
child! tell me how it was, make haste.&nbsp; I heard it from Mr.
Burnet as I came down to dinner.&nbsp; We have a dozen people at
dinner.&nbsp; I told him not to mention it to my mother, and rode
off to hear the truth.&nbsp; Make haste, half the people were
come when I set off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The horse&rsquo;s caperings so discomposed Maurice that he
could scarcely collect his wits enough to answer: &lsquo;Some
signal rocket on a new principle&mdash;detonating powder,
composed of oxymuriate&mdash;Oh!&nbsp; Rotherwood, take
care!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak sense, and go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Phyllis came in, banged the door, and the
vibration caused the explosion,&rsquo; said Maurice, scared into
finishing promptly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh! banging the door?&nbsp; You had better not tell
that story at school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Rotherwood, the deton&mdash;Oh! that
horse&mdash;you will be off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not half so dangerous as patent rockets.&nbsp; Is Emily
satisfied with such stuff?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that fulminating
silver&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does Robert Devereux say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, Rotherwood, I could show you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Show me?&nbsp; No; if rockets are so perilous I shall
have nothing to do with them.&nbsp; Stand still, Cedric!&nbsp;
Just tell me about Ada.&nbsp; Is there much harm done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her face is scorched a good deal, but they say it will
soon be right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad&mdash;we will send to inquire to-morrow, but
I cannot come&mdash;ha, ha! a new infernal machine.&nbsp;
Good-bye, Friar Bacon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Away he went, and Maurice stood looking after him with
complacent disdain.&nbsp; &lsquo;There they go, Cedric and
Rotherwood, equally well provided with brains!&nbsp; What is the
use of talking science to either?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was late when he reached the house, and his two sisters
shortly came down to tea, with news that Adeline was asleep and
Phyllis was going to bed.&nbsp; The accident was again talked
over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;I do not understand it,
but I suppose papa will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The telling papa is a bad part of the affair, with
William and Eleanor there too,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not mean to speak to Phyllis about it
again,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;it makes her cry so
terribly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will come out fast enough,&rsquo; sighed
Maurice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>More than once in the course of the night did poor Phyllis
wake and cry, and the next day was the most wretched she had ever
spent; she was not allowed to stay in the nursery, and the
schoolroom was uninhabitable, so she wandered listlessly about
the garden, sometimes creeping down to the churchyard, where she
looked up at the old tower, or pondered over the graves, and
sometimes forgetting her troubles in converse with the dogs, in
counting the rings in the inside of a foxglove flower, or in
rescuing tadpoles stranded on the broad leaf of a water-lily.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Her sisters and brothers were not less forlorn.&nbsp; Emily
sighed and lamented; Adeline was feverish and petulant; and Jane
toiled in vain to please and soothe both, and to comfort Maurice;
but with all her good-temper and good-nature she had not the
spirit which alone could enable her to be a comfort to any
one.&nbsp; Ada whined, fretted, and was disobedient, and from
Maurice she met with nothing but rebuffs; he was silent and
sullen, and spent most of the day in the workshop, slowly planing
scraps of deal board, and watching with a careless eye the curled
shavings float to the ground.</p>
<p>In the course of the afternoon Alethea and Marianne came to
inquire after the patient.&nbsp; Jane came down to them and
talked very fast, but when they asked for a further explanation
of the cause of the accident, Jane declared that Maurice said it
was impossible that any one who did not understand chemistry
should know how it happened, and Alethea went away strongly
reminded that it was no affair of hers.</p>
<p>Notes passed between the New Court and the vicarage, but Mr.
Devereux was feeling the effect of his yesterday&rsquo;s exertion
too much to repeat it, and no persuasion of the sisters could
induce Maurice to visit him.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Still in his eyes his soul revealing,<br />
He dreams not, knows not of concealing,<br />
Does all he does with single mind,<br />
And thinks of others that are kind.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> travellers were expected to
arrive at about seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and in
accordance with a well-known taste of Eleanor&rsquo;s, Emily had
ordered no dinner, but a substantial meal under the name of
tea.&nbsp; When the sound of carriage wheels was heard, Jane was
with Adeline, Maurice was in his retreat at the Old Court, and it
was with no cheerful alacrity that Emily went alone into the
hall.&nbsp; Phyllis was already at the front door, and the
instant Mr. Mohun set foot on the threshold, her hand grasped his
coat, and her shrill voice cried in his ear, &lsquo;Papa, I am
very sorry I blew up the gunpowder and burnt Ada.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, my dear? where is Ada?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In bed.&nbsp; I blew up the gunpowder and burnt her
face,&rsquo; repeated Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have had an accident,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;but
I hope it is nothing very serious, only poor Ada is a sad
figure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In another moment Mr. Mohun and Eleanor were on the way to the
nursery; Lilias was following, but she recollected that a general
rush into a sickroom was not desirable, and therefore paused and
came back to the hall.&nbsp; The worst was over with Phyllis when
the confession had been made.&nbsp; She was in raptures at the
sight of the baby, and was presently showing the nurse the way
upstairs, but her brother William called her back:
&lsquo;Phyllis, you have not spoken to any one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis turned, and came down slowly in her most ungainly
manner, believing herself in too great disgrace to be noticed by
anybody, and she was quite surprised and comforted to be greeted
by her brothers and Lily just as usual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how did you meet with this misfortune?&rsquo; asked
Mr. Hawkesworth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I banged the door, and made it go off,&rsquo; said
Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can you mean?&rsquo; said William, in a tone of
surprise, which Phyllis took for anger, and she hid her face to
stifle her sobs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, do not frighten her,&rsquo; said Claude&rsquo;s
kind voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Run and make friends with your nephew, Phyllis,&rsquo;
said Mr. Hawkesworth; &lsquo;do not greet us with
crying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;First tell me what is become of Maurice,&rsquo; said
Claude, &lsquo;is he blown up too?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he is at the Old Court,&rsquo; said Phyllis.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Shall I tell him that you are come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will look for him,&rsquo; said Claude, and out he
went.</p>
<p>The others dispersed in different directions, and did not
assemble again for nearly half an hour, when they all met in the
drawing-room to drink tea; Claude and Maurice were the last to
appear, and, on entering, the first thing the former said was,
&lsquo;Where is Phyllis?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the nursery,&rsquo; said Jane; &lsquo;she has had
her supper, and chooses to stay with Ada.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has any one found out the history of the
accident?&rsquo; said William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have vainly been trying to make sense of
Maurice&rsquo;s account,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sense!&rsquo; said William, &lsquo;there is
none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am perfectly bewildered,&rsquo; said Lily;
&lsquo;every one has a different story, only consenting in making
Phyllis the victim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; added Claude, &lsquo;I strongly suspect she
is not in fault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you doubt what she says herself?&rsquo; said
Eleanor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does she say herself?&rsquo; said William,
&lsquo;nothing but that she shut the door, and what does that
amount to?&mdash;Nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She says she touched the powder,&rsquo; interposed
Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is another matter,&rsquo; said William; &lsquo;no
one told me of her touching the powder.&nbsp; But why do you not
ask her?&nbsp; She is publicly condemned without a
hearing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who accuses her?&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can hardly tell,&rsquo; said Emily; &lsquo;she met
us, saying she was very sorry.&nbsp; Yes, she accuses
herself.&nbsp; Every one has believed it to be her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, but at last Emily said, &lsquo;How would
you account for it otherwise?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not yet heard the circumstances.&nbsp; Maurice,
I wish to hear your account.&nbsp; I will not now ask how you
procured the powder.&nbsp; Whoever was the immediate cause of the
accident, you are chiefly to blame.&nbsp; Where was the
powder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maurice gave his theory and his facts, ending with the
powder-horn being driven out of the window upon the green.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hear,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,
Maurice, did you not say that Phyllis touched the powder?&nbsp;
How do you reconcile that with this incomprehensible
statement?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She might have done that before,&rsquo; said
Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now call Phyllis,&rsquo; said his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it not very formidable for her to be examined before
such an assembly?&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The accusation has been public, and the investigation
shall be the same,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you do not think she did it, papa?&rsquo; cried
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not by shutting the door,&rsquo; said William.</p>
<p>Phyllis entered, and Mr. Mohun, holding out both hands to her,
drew her towards him, and placing her with her back to the
others, still retained her hands, while he said, &lsquo;Phyllis,
do not be frightened, but tell me where you were when the powder
exploded?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coming into the room,&rsquo; said Phyllis, in a
trembling voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where had you been?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fetching a wafer out of the drawing-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was the wafer for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To put on Emily&rsquo;s letter, which she told us to
send.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where was Ada?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the schoolroom, reading the direction of the
letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me exactly what happened when you came
back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I opened the door, and there was a flash, and a bang,
and a smoke, and Ada tumbled down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have one more question to ask.&nbsp; When did you
touch the powder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When it had exploded?&nbsp; Take care what you
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it naughty?&nbsp; I am very sorry,&rsquo; said
Phyllis, beginning to cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What powder did you touch?&nbsp; I do not understand
you, tell me quietly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I touched the powder-horn.&nbsp; What went off was only
a little in a paper on the table, and there was a great deal
more.&nbsp; When the rocket blew up there was a great noise, and
Ada and I both screamed, and Hannah ran in and took up Ada in her
arms.&nbsp; Then I saw a great fire, and looked, and saw
Emily&rsquo;s music-book, and all the papers blazing.&nbsp; So I
thought if it got to the powder it would blow up again, and I
laid hold of the horn and threw it out of the window.&nbsp; That
is all I know, papa, only I hope you are not very angry with
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked into his face, not knowing how to interpret the
unusual expression she saw there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Angry with you!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, my
dear child, you have acted with great presence of mind.&nbsp; You
have saved your sister and Hannah from great danger, and I am
very sorry that you have been unjustly treated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then gave his little daughter a kiss, and putting his hand
on her head, added, &lsquo;Whoever caused the explosion, Phyllis
is quite free from blame, and I wish every one to understand
this, because she has been unjustly accused, without examination,
and because she has borne it patiently, and without attempting to
justify herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very right,&rsquo; observed Eleanor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shake hands, Phyllis,&rsquo; said William.</p>
<p>The others said more with their eyes than with their
lips.&nbsp; Phyllis stood like one in a dream, and fixing her
bewildered looks upon Claude, said, &lsquo;Did not I do
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Phyllis, you had nothing to do with it,&rsquo; was
the general exclamation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maurice said it was the door,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maurice talked nonsense,&rsquo; said Claude; &lsquo;you
were only foolish in believing him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis went up to Claude, and laid her head on his arm; Mr.
Hawkesworth held out his hand to her, but she did not look up,
and Claude withdrawing his arm, and raising her head, found that
she was crying.&nbsp; Eleanor and Lilias both rose, and came
towards her but Claude made them a sign, and led her away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a fine story this will be for Reginald,&rsquo;
said William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And for Rotherwood,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not see how it happened,&rsquo; said Eleanor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course Ada did it herself,&rsquo; said William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Maurice.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was all
from Emily&rsquo;s setting them to seal her letter, that is plain
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would not Ada have said so?&rsquo; asked Eleanor.</p>
<p>Lily sighed at the thought of what Eleanor had yet to
learn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you tell them to seal your letter, Emily?&rsquo;
said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to say that I did tell them to send
it,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;but I said nothing about sealing,
as Jane remembers, and I forgot that Maurice&rsquo;s gunpowder
was in the room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor shook her head sorrowfully, and looked down at her
knitting, and Lily knew that her mind was made up respecting
little Henry&rsquo;s dwelling-place.</p>
<p>It was some comfort to have raised no false expectations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ada must not be frightened and agitated
to-night,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;but I hope you will talk
to her to-morrow, Eleanor.&nbsp; Well, Claude, have you made
Phyllis understand that she is acquitted?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scarcely,&rsquo; said Claude; &lsquo;she is so overcome
and worn out, that I thought she had better go to bed, and wake
in her proper senses to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very unconscious heroine,&rsquo; said William.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She is a wonder&mdash;I never thought her anything but an
honest sort of romp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have long thought her a wonderful specimen of
obedience,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.</p>
<p>William and Claude now walked to the parsonage, and the
council broke up; but it must not be supposed that this was the
last that Emily and Maurice heard on the subject.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">JOYS AND SORROWS</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Complaint was heard on every part<br />
Of something disarranged.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, Sunday, was one of
the most marked in Lily&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; It was the first time
she saw Mr. Devereux after his illness, and though Claude had
told her he was going to church, it gave her a sudden thrill of
joy to see him there once more, and perhaps she never felt more
thankful than when his name was read before the
Thanksgiving.&nbsp; After the service there was an exchange of
greetings, but Lily spoke no word, she felt too happy and too
awe-struck to say anything, and she walked back to the New Court
in silence.</p>
<p>In the afternoon she had hopes that a blessing would be
granted to her, for which at one time she had scarcely dared to
hope; and she felt convinced that so it would be when she saw
that Mr. Devereux wore his surplice, although, as in the morning,
his friend read the service.&nbsp; After the Second Lesson there
was a pause, and then Mr. Devereux left the chair by the altar,
walked along the aisle, and took his stand on the step of the
font.&nbsp; Lily&rsquo;s heart beat high as she saw who were
gathering round him&mdash;Mrs. Eden, Andrew Grey, James
Harrington, and Mrs. Naylor, who held in her arms a healthy,
rosy-checked boy of a year old.</p>
<p>She could not have described the feelings which made her eyes
overflow with tears, as she saw Mr. Devereux&rsquo;s thin hand
sprinkle the drops over the brow of the child, and heard him say,
&lsquo;Robert, I baptize thee&rsquo;&mdash;words which she had
heard in dreams, and then awakened to remember that the parish
was at enmity with the pastor, the child unbaptized, and herself,
in part, the cause.</p>
<p>The name of the little boy was an additional pledge of
reconciliation, and at the same time it made her feel again what
had been the price of his baptism.&nbsp; When she looked back
upon the dreary feelings which she had so lately experienced, it
seemed to her as if she might believe that this christening was,
as it were, a pledge of pardon, and an earnest of better
things.</p>
<p>Naylor, who had recovered much more slowly than Mr. Devereux,
was at church for the first time, and after the service Mr. Mohun
sought him out in the churchyard, and heartily shook hands with
him.&nbsp; Lily would gladly have followed his example, but she
only stood by Eleanor and Mrs. Weston, who were speaking to Mrs.
Eden and Mrs. Naylor, admiring the little boy, and praising him
for his good behaviour in church.</p>
<p>Love of babies was a strong bond between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.
Hawkesworth, who seemed to become well acquainted from the first
moment that little Henry was mentioned; and Lily was well pleased
to see that in Jane&rsquo;s phrase Eleanor &lsquo;took to her
friends so well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And yet this day brought with it some annoyances, which once
would have fretted her so much as to interfere even with such joy
as she now felt.&nbsp; The song, with which she had taken so much
pains, ought to have been sent home a week before, but owing to
the delay caused by Emily&rsquo;s carelessness, it had been burnt
in the fire in the schoolroom, and Lily could not feel herself
forgiven till she had talked the disaster over in private with
her friend, and this was out of her power throughout the day, for
something always prevented her from getting Alethea alone.&nbsp;
In the morning Jane stuck close to her, and in the afternoon
William walked to the school gate with them.&nbsp; But
Alethea&rsquo;s manner was kinder towards her than ever, and she
was quite satisfied about her.</p>
<p>It gave her more pain to perceive that Emily in every possible
manner avoided being alone with her.&nbsp; It was by her desire
that Phyllis came to sleep in their room; she would keep Jane
talking there, give Esther some employment which kept her in
their presence, linger in the drawing-room while Lilias was
dressing, and at bedtime be too sleepy to say anything but
good-night.</p>
<p>That Sunday was a sorrowful one to Eleanor; for in the course
of the conversation with Ada, which Mr. Mohun had desired her to
hold, she became conscious of the little girl&rsquo;s
double-dealing ways.&nbsp; It was only by a very close
cross-examination that she was able to extract from her a true
account of the disaster, and though Ada never went so far as
actually to tell a falsehood, it was evident that she was willing
to conceal as much as possible, and to throw the blame on other
people.&nbsp; And when the real facts were confessed she did not
seem able to comprehend why she was regarded with displeasure;
her instinct of truth and obedience was lost for the time, and
Eleanor saw it with the utmost pain.&nbsp; Adeline had been her
especial darling, and cold as her manner had often been towards
the others, it ever was warm towards the motherless little one,
whom she had tended and cherished with most anxious care from her
earliest infancy.&nbsp; She had left her gentle, candid, and
affectionate; a loving, engaging, little creature, and how did
she find her now?&nbsp; Her fair bright face disfigured, her
caresses affected, her mind turned to deceit and
prevarication!&nbsp; Well might Eleanor feel it more than ever
painful to leave her own little Henry to the care of others; and
well it was for her that she had learned to find comfort in the
consciousness that her duty was clear.</p>
<p>The next morning Emily learned what was Henry&rsquo;s
destination.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Eleanor,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;why do you not
leave him here?&nbsp; We should be so rejoiced to have
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, I am afraid it is out of the
question,&rsquo; answered Eleanor, quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, dear Eleanor?&nbsp; You know how glad we should
be.&nbsp; I should have thought,&rsquo; proceeded Emily, a little
hurt, &lsquo;that you would have wished him to live in your own
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor did not speak, and Emily, who had the little boy in
her arms, went on talking to him: &lsquo;Come, baby, let us
persuade mamma to let you stay with Aunt Emily.&nbsp; Ask papa,
Henry, won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Seriously, Eleanor, has Frank
considered how much better it would be to have him in the
country?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has, Emily; he once wished much to leave him
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure grandpapa would like it,&rsquo; said
Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you observe, Eleanor, how fond he is of
baby, always calling him Harry too, as if he liked the sound of
the name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has all been talked over, Emily, and it cannot
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With papa?&rsquo; asked Emily in surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, with Lily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With Lily!&rsquo; exclaimed Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did not
Aunt Lily wish to keep you, Harry?&nbsp; I thought she was very
fond of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better inquire no further,&rsquo; said Eleanor,
&lsquo;except of your own conscience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did Lily think us unfit to take care of him?&rsquo;
asked Emily, in surprise.</p>
<p>As she spoke Lily herself came in, the key of the storeroom in
her hand, and looks of consternation on her face.&nbsp; She came
to announce a terrible deficiency in the preserved quinces, which
she herself had carefully put aside on a shelf in the storeroom,
and which Emily said she had not touched in her absence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me see,&rsquo; said Eleanor, rising, and setting
off to the storeroom; Emily and Lily followed, with a sad
suspicion of the truth.&nbsp; On the way they looked into the
nursery, to give little Henry to his nurse, and to ask Jane, who
was sitting with Ada, what she remembered about it.&nbsp; Jane
knew nothing, and they went on to the storeroom, where Eleanor,
quite in her element, began rummaging, arranging, and sighing
over the confusion, while Lily lent a helping hand, and Emily
stood by, wishing that her sister would not trouble
herself.&nbsp; Presently Jane came running up with a saucer in
her hand, containing a quarter of a quince and some syrup, which
she said she had found in the nursery cupboard, in searching for
a puzzle which Ada wanted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;I should guess that Miss
Ada herself knew something about it, for when I could not find
the puzzle in the right-hand cupboard, she was so very unwilling
that I should look into that one; she said there was nothing
there but the boys&rsquo; old playthings and Esther&rsquo;s
clothes.&nbsp; And I do not know whether you saw how she fidgeted
when you were talking about the quinces, before you went
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is much too plain,&rsquo; sighed Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh! Rachel, why did we not listen to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you suppose,&rsquo; said Eleanor, &lsquo;that Ada
has been in the habit of taking the key and helping
herself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;but that Esther has
helped her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Eleanor, &lsquo;I never thought it wise
to take her, but how could she get the key?&nbsp; You do not mean
that you trusted it out of your own keeping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It began while we were ill,&rsquo; faltered Emily,
&lsquo;and afterwards it was difficult to bring matters into
their former order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But oh, Eleanor, what is to be done?&rsquo; sighed
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak to papa, of course,&rsquo; said Eleanor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is gone to the castle, and in the meantime we had
better take an exact account of everything here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Esther?&nbsp; And Ada?&rsquo; inquired the
sisters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it will be better to speak to him before making
so grave an accusation,&rsquo; said Eleanor.</p>
<p>They now commenced that wearisome occupation&mdash;a complete
setting-to-rights; Eleanor counted, weighed, and measured, and
extended her cares from the stores to every other household
matter.&nbsp; Emily made her escape, and went to sit with Ada;
but Lily and Jane toiled for several hours with Eleanor, till
Lily was so heated and wearied that she was obliged to give up a
walk to Broomhill, and spend another day without a talk with
Alethea.&nbsp; However, she was so patient, ready, and
good-humoured, that Eleanor was well pleased with her.&nbsp; She
could hardly think of the slight vexation, when her mind was full
of sorrow and shame on Esther&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; It was she
who, contrary to the advice of her elders, had insisted on
bringing her into the house; she had allowed temptation to be set
in her way, and had not taken sufficient pains to strengthen her
principles; and how could she do otherwise than feel guilty of
all Esther&rsquo;s faults, and of those into which she had led
Adeline?</p>
<p>On Mr. Mohun&rsquo;s return Ada was interrogated.&nbsp; She
pitied herself&mdash;said she did not think papa would be
angry&mdash;prevaricated&mdash;and tried to coax away his
inquiries, but all in vain; and at length, by slow degrees, the
confession was drawn from her that she had been used to asking
Esther for morsels of sweet things when she was sent to the
storeroom; that afterwards she had seen her packing up some tea
and sugar to take to her mother, and that Esther on that
occasion, and several others, purchased her silence by giving her
a share of pilfered sweetmeats.&nbsp; Telling her that he only
spared her a very severe punishment for the present, on account
of her illness, Mr. Mohun left her, and on his way downstairs met
Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phyl,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;did Esther ever give you
sweet things out of the storeroom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once, papa, when she had been putting out some currant
jam, she offered me what had been left in the spoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you take it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, papa, for Eleanor used to say it was a bad trick to
lick out spoons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever know that she took tea and sugar from the
storeroom, for her mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Took home tea and sugar to her mother!&nbsp; She could
not have done it, papa.&nbsp; It would be stealing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esther, who was next called for, cried a great deal, and
begged for pardon, pleading again and again that&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was mother,&rsquo; an answer which made her young
mistresses again sigh over the remembrance of Rachel&rsquo;s
disregarded advice.&nbsp; Her fate was left for consideration and
consultation with Mr. Devereux, for Mr. Mohun, seeing himself to
blame for having allowed her to be placed in a situation of so
much trial, and thinking that there was much that was good about
her, did not like to send her to her home, where she was likely
to learn nothing but what was bad.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">LOVE&rsquo;S LABOUR LOST</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And well, with ready hand and heart,<br />

Did one dear inmate take her part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last asleep, the earliest waking.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of the afternoon Lord
Rotherwood and Florence called, to see Eleanor, inquire after
Ada, and make the final arrangements for going to a morning
concert at Raynham the next day.&nbsp; Lady Rotherwood was afraid
of the fatigue, and Florence therefore wished to accompany her
cousins, who, as Eleanor meant to stay at home, were to be under
Mrs. Weston&rsquo;s protection.&nbsp; Lady Florence and her
brother, therefore, agreed to ride home by Broomhill, and mention
the plan to Mrs. Weston, and took their leave, appointing
Adam&rsquo;s shop as the place of rendezvous.</p>
<p>Next morning Emily, Lilias, and Jane happened to be together
in the drawing-room, when Mr. Mohun and Claude came in, the
former saying to Lily, &lsquo;Here is the mason&rsquo;s account
for the gravestone which you wished to have put up to Agnes Eden;
it comes to two pounds.&nbsp; You undertook half the expense, and
as Claude is going to Raynham, he will pay for it if you will
give him your sovereign.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;but first I must ask
Emily to pay me for the London commissions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emily repented not having had a private conference with
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you have not settled your accounts,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope Lily has not ruined you,
Emily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought her a mirror of prudence,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Emily, is the sovereign forthcoming?&nbsp; I am
going directly, for Frank has something to do at Raynham, and
William is going to try his gray in the phaeton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you will think me very silly,&rsquo; said
Emily, after some deliberation, &lsquo;but I hope Lily will not
be very angry when I confess that seven shillings is the sum
total of my property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Emily,&rsquo; cried Lily, in dismay, &lsquo;what
has become of your five pounds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I gave them as a subscription for a clergyman&rsquo;s
widow in distress,&rsquo; said Emily; &lsquo;it was the impulse
of a moment, I could not help it, and, dear Lily, I hope it will
not inconvenience you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If papa will be kind enough to wait for this pound till
Michaelmas,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would wait willingly,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun,
&lsquo;but I will not see you cheated.&nbsp; How much does she
owe you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The commissions came to six pounds three,&rsquo; said
Lily, looking down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Lily,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;you forget the old
debt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; whispered Lily; but Mr. Mohun asked
what Jane had said, and Claude repeated her speech, upon which he
inquired, &lsquo;What old debt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa,&rsquo; said Emily, in her most candid tone,
&lsquo;I do not know what I should have done but for Lily&rsquo;s
kindness.&nbsp; Really, I cannot get on with my present
allowance; being the eldest, so many expenses come upon
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then am I to understand,&rsquo; replied Mr. Mohun,
&lsquo;that your foolish vanity has led you to encroach on your
sister&rsquo;s kindness, and to borrow of her what you had no
reasonable hope of repaying?&nbsp; Again, Lily, what does she owe
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emily felt the difference between the sharp, curious eyes with
which Jane regarded her, and the sorrowful downcast looks of
Lily, who replied, &lsquo;The old debt is four pounds, but that
does not signify.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; resumed her father, &lsquo;I cannot blame
you for your good-nature, though an older person might have acted
otherwise.&nbsp; You must have managed wonderfully well, to look
always so well dressed with only half your proper income.&nbsp;
Here is the amount of the debt.&nbsp; Is it right?&nbsp; And,
Lily, one thing more; I wish to thank you for what you have done
towards keeping this house in order.&nbsp; You have worked hard,
and endured much, and from all I can gather, you have prevented
much mischief.&nbsp; Much has unfairly been thrown upon you, and
you have well and steadily done your duty.&nbsp; For you, Emily,
I have more to say to you, but I shall not enter on it at
present, for it is late.&nbsp; You had better get ready, or you
will keep the others waiting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think I can go,&rsquo; sighed Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are wanted,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
do not think your aunt would like Florence to go without
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily had trembled as much under her father&rsquo;s praise as
Emily under his blame.&nbsp; She did not feel as if his
commendation was merited, and longed to tell him of her faults
and follies, but this was no fit time, and she hastened to
prepare for her expedition, her spirits scarcely in time for a
party of pleasure.&nbsp; Jane talked about the 30th, and asked
questions about London, all the way to Raynham, and both Emily
and Lily were glad to join in her chatter, in hopes of relieving
their own embarrassment.</p>
<p>On arriving at the place of meeting they found Lady Florence
watching for them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you are come,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;Rotherwood will always set out either too soon or too
late, and this time it was too soon, so here we have been full a
quarter of an hour, but he does not care.&nbsp; There he is,
quite engrossed with his book.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Rotherwood was standing by the counter, reading so
intently that he did not see his cousins&rsquo; arrival.&nbsp;
When they entered he just looked up, shook hands, asked after
Ada, and went on reading.&nbsp; Lily began looking for some books
for the school, which she had long wished for, and was now able
to purchase; Emily sat down in a melancholy, abstracted mood, and
Florence and Jane stood together talking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know you are all to come early,&rsquo; said the
former, &lsquo;I do not know how we should manage without
you.&nbsp; Rotherwood insists on having everything the same
day&mdash;poor people first, and gentry and farmers
altogether.&nbsp; Mamma does not like it, and I expect we shall
be dreadfully tired; but he says he will not have the honest poor
men put out for the fashionables; and you know we are all to
dance with everybody.&nbsp; But Jenny, who is this crossing the
street?&nbsp; Look, you have an eye for oddities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Fitchett, the subscription-hunter,&rsquo; said
Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is actually coming to hunt us.&nbsp; I believe I
have my purse.&nbsp; Oh! Emily is to be the first
victim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Fitchett advanced to Emily, and saying that she believed
she had the honour to address Miss Mohun, began to tell her that
her friend having been prematurely informed of her small efforts,
had with a noble spirit of independence begged that the
subscription might not be continued, and that what had already
been given might be returned, and she rejoiced in this
opportunity of making the explanation.&nbsp; But Miss Fitchett
could not bear to relinquish the five-pound note, and added, that
perhaps Miss Mohun might not object to apply her subscription to
some other object, the Dorcas Society for instance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, I have no interest in the Dorcas
Society,&rsquo; said Emily; a reply which brought upon her a full
account of all its aims and objects; and as still her polite
looks spoke nothing of assent, Miss Fitchett went on with a
string of other societies, speaking the louder and the more
eagerly in the hope of attracting the attention of the young
marquis and his sister.&nbsp; Emily was easily overwhelmed with
words, and not thinking it lady-like to claim her money, yet
feeling that none of these societies were fit objects for it, she
stood confused and irresolute, unwilling either to consent or
refuse.&nbsp; Jane, perceiving her difficulty, turned to Lord
Rotherwood, and rousing him from his book, explained
Emily&rsquo;s distress in a few words, and sent him to her
rescue.&nbsp; He stepped forward just as Miss Fitchett, taking
silence for consent, was proceeding to thank Emily; &lsquo;I
think you misunderstand Miss Mohun,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Since her subscription is not needed by the person for
whom it was intended, she would be glad to have it
restored.&nbsp; She does not wish to encourage any unauthorised
societies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Boy as he was, in appearance still more than in age, there was
a dignity in his manner which, together with the principle on
which he spoke, overawed Miss Fitchett even more than his
rank.&nbsp; She only said, &lsquo;Oh! my lord, I beg your
pardon.&nbsp; Certainly, only&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The note was placed in Emily&rsquo;s hands, and with a bow
from Lord Rotherwood, she retreated, murmuring to herself the
remonstrance which she had not courage to bestow upon the
Marquis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, thank you, Rotherwood,&rsquo; said Emily;
&lsquo;you have done me a great service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, Rotherwood,&rsquo; said Florence; &lsquo;you
have given the old lady something to reflect upon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Made a public announcement of principle,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was determined to give her a reason,&rsquo; said the
Marquis, laughing, &lsquo;but I assure you I felt like the stork
with its head in the wolf&rsquo;s mouth, I thought she would give
me a screed of doctrine.&nbsp; How came you to let your property
get unto her clutches, Emily?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a subscription for Mrs. Aylmer,&rsquo; said
Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our curate&rsquo;s wife!&rsquo; cried he with a start;
&lsquo;how was it?&nbsp; Florence, did you know anything?&nbsp; I
thought she was in London.&nbsp; Why were we in the dark?&nbsp;
Tell me all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All I know is that she is living somewhere in Raynham,
and last week there was a paper here to say that she was in want
of the means of fitting out her son for India.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, Johnny, I know my father did get a promise
for him&mdash;well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is all I know, except that she does not choose to
be a beggar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Mrs. Aylmer! shameful neglect! she shall not be
ill-used any longer, I will find her out this instant.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t wait for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And after a few words to Mr. Adams, off he went, walking as
fast as he could, and leaving the young ladies not without fear
of another invasion.&nbsp; Soon, however, the brothers came in,
and presently after Mrs. Weston appeared.&nbsp; It was agreed
that Lord Rotherwood should be left to his own devices, and they
set out for the concert-room.&nbsp; Poor Florence lost much
pleasure in disappointment at his non-appearance, but when the
concert was over they found him sitting in the carriage,
reading.&nbsp; As soon as they appeared he sprang out, and came
to meet them, pouring rapidly out a history of his
adventures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you have found them, and what can be done for
them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything ought to be done, but Mrs. Aylmer has a
spirit of independence.&nbsp; That foolish woman&rsquo;s
advertisement was unknown to her till Emily&rsquo;s five pounds
came in, so fine a nest-egg that she could not help cackling,
whereupon Mrs. Aylmer insisted on having every farthing
returned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can she provide the boy&rsquo;s outfit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She says so, or rather that her daughter can, but I
shall see about that.&nbsp; It is worth while to be of age.&nbsp;
Imagine!&nbsp; That bank which failed was the end of my
father&rsquo;s legacy.&nbsp; They must have lived on a fraction
of nothing!&nbsp; Edward went to sea.&nbsp; Miss Aylmer went out
as a governess.&nbsp; Now she is at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Aylmer!&rsquo; exclaimed Miss Weston, &lsquo;I
know she was a clergyman&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Do you know the
name of the family she lived with?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it Grant?&rsquo; said William.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
remember hearing of her going to some Grants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was,&rsquo; said Alethea; &lsquo;she must be the
same.&nbsp; Is she at home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood, &lsquo;and you may
soon see her, for I mean to have them all to stay at the castle
as soon as our present visitors are gone.&nbsp; My mother and
Florence shall call upon them on Friday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;I have not found out
what brought them back to Raynham.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you lived at Beechcroft all your life, and never
discovered that there is a grammar-school at Raynham, with
special privileges for the sons of clergymen of the
diocese?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few more words, and the cousins parted; Emily by no means
sorry that she had been obliged to go to Raynham.&nbsp; She
tendered the five-pound note to her father, but he desired her to
wait till Friday, and then to bring him a full account of her
expenditure of the year.&nbsp; Her irregular ways made this
almost impossible, especially as in the present state of affairs
she wished to avoid a private conference with either Lily or
Jane.&nbsp; She was glad that an invitation to dine and sleep at
the castle on Wednesday would save her from the peril of having
to talk to Lily in the evening.&nbsp; Reginald came home on
Tuesday, to the great joy of all the party, and especially to
that of Phyllis.&nbsp; This little maiden was more puzzled by the
events that had taken place than conscious of the feeling which
she had once thought must be so delightful.&nbsp; She could
scarcely help perceiving that every one was much more kind to her
than usual, especially Claude and Lily, and Lord Rotherwood said
things which she could not at all understand.&nbsp; Her
observation to Reginald was, &lsquo;Was it not lucky I had a
cough on Twelfth Day, or Claude would not have told me what to do
about gunpowder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reginald troubled Phyllis much by declaring that nothing
should induce him to kiss his nephew, and she was terribly
shocked by the indifference with which Eleanor treated his
neglect, even when it branched out into abuse of babies in
general, and in particular of Henry&rsquo;s bald head and
turned-up nose.</p>
<p>In the evening of Wednesday Phyllis was sitting with Ada in
the nursery, when Reginald came up with the news that the party
downstairs were going to practise country dances.&nbsp; Eleanor
was to play, Claude was to dance with Lily, and Frank with Jane,
and he himself wanted Phyllis for a partner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; sighed Ada, &lsquo;I wish I was there to
dance with you, Redgie!&nbsp; What are the others
doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maurice is reading, and William went out as soon as
dinner was over; make haste, Phyl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; said Ada, &lsquo;I shall be
alone all to-morrow, and I want you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Reginald, &lsquo;do you think she
is to sit poking here all day, playing with those foolish London
things of yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am ill, Redgie.&nbsp; I wish you would not be
cross.&nbsp; Everybody is cross to me now, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will stay, Ada,&rsquo; said Phyllis.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
know, Redgie, I dance like a cow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You dance better than nothing,&rsquo; said Reginald,
&lsquo;I must have you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you are not ill, Redgie,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>He went down in displeasure, and was forced to consider Sir
Maurice&rsquo;s picture as his partner, until presently the door
opened, and Phyllis appeared.&nbsp; &lsquo;So you have thought
better of it,&rsquo; cried he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Phyllis, &lsquo;I cannot come to dance,
but Ada wants you to leave off playing.&nbsp; She says the music
makes her unhappy, for it makes her think about
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather selfish, Miss Ada,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay here, Phyllis, now you are come,&rsquo; said Mr.
Mohun, &lsquo;I will go and speak to Ada.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis was now captured, and made to take her place opposite
to Reginald; but more than once she sighed under the apprehension
that Ada was receiving a lecture.&nbsp; This was the case; and
very little did poor Ada comprehend the change that had taken
place in the conduct of almost every one towards her; she did not
perceive that she was particularly naughty, and yet she had
suddenly become an object of blame, instead of a spoiled
pet.&nbsp; Formerly her little slynesses had been unnoticed, and
her overbearing ways towards Phyllis scarcely remarked, but now
they were continually mentioned as grievous faults.&nbsp; Esther,
her especial friend and comforter, was scarcely allowed to come
into the same room with her; Hannah treated her with a kind of
grave, silent respect, far from the familiarity which she liked;
little Henry&rsquo;s nurse never would talk to her, and if it had
not been for Phyllis, she would have been very miserable.&nbsp;
On Phyllis, however, she repaid herself for all the
mortifications that she received, while the sweet-tempered little
girl took all her fretfulness and exactions as results of her
illness, and went on pitying her, and striving to please her.</p>
<p>When Phyllis came up to wish her good-night, she was received
with an exclamation at her lateness in a peevish tone:
&lsquo;Yes, I am late,&rsquo; said Phyllis, merrily, &lsquo;but
we had not done dancing till tea-time, and then Eleanor was so
kind as to say I might sit up to have some tea with
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! and you quite forgot how tiresome it is up here,
with nobody to speak to,&rsquo; said Ada.&nbsp; &lsquo;How cross
they were not to stop the music when I said it made me
miserable!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Claude said it was selfish to want to stop five
people&rsquo;s pleasure for one,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am so ill,&rsquo; said Ada.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
Claude was as uncomfortable as I am, he would know how to be
sorry for me.&nbsp; And only think&mdash;Phyl, what are you
doing?&nbsp; Do not you know I do not like the moonlight to come
on me.&nbsp; It is like a great face laughing at me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I like the moon so much!&rsquo; said Phyllis,
creeping behind the curtain to look out, &lsquo;there is
something so white and bright in it; when it comes on the
bed-clothes, it makes me go to sleep, thinking about white robes,
oh! and all sorts of nice things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear the moon,&rsquo; said Ada; &lsquo;do
not you know, Maurice says that the moon makes the people go mad,
and that is the reason it is called lunacy, after <i>la
lune</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I asked Miss Weston about that,&rsquo; said Phyllis,
&lsquo;because of the Psalm, and she said it was because it was
dangerous to go to sleep in the open air in hot countries.&nbsp;
Ada, I wish you could see now.&nbsp; There is the great round
moon in the middle of the sky, and the sky such a beautiful
colour, and a few such great bright stars, and the trees so dark,
and the white lilies standing up on the black pond, and the lawn
all white with dew! what a fine day it will be
to-morrow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fine day for you!&rsquo; said Ada, &lsquo;but only
think of poor me all alone by myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will have baby,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baby&mdash;if he could talk it would be all very
well.&nbsp; It is just like the cross people in books.&nbsp; Here
I shall lie and cry all the time, while you are dancing about as
merry as can be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Ada, you will not do that,&rsquo; said Phyllis,
with tears in her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is baby with all his
pretty ways, and you may teach him to say Aunt Ada, and I will
bring you in numbers of flowers, and there is your new doll, and
all the pretty things that came from London, and the new book of
Fairy Tales, and all sorts&mdash;oh! no, do not cry,
Ada.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I shall, for I shall think of you dancing, and not
caring for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do care, Ada&mdash;why do you say that I do
not?&nbsp; I cannot bear it, Ada, dear Ada.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t, or you would not go and leave me
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, Ada, I will not go,&rsquo; said Phyllis; &lsquo;I
could not bear to leave you crying here all alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, dear good Phyl, but I think you will not
have much loss.&nbsp; You know you do not like dancing, and you
cannot do it well, and they will be sure to laugh at
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I daresay Redgie and Marianne will tell us all
about it,&rsquo; said Phyllis, sighing.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should
rather like to have seen it, but they will tell us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then do you promise to stay?&mdash;there&rsquo;s a
dear,&rsquo; said Ada.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Phyllis.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cousin Robert is
coming in, and that will be very nice, and I hope he will not
look as he did the day the gunpowder went off&mdash;oh,
dear!&rsquo;&nbsp; She went back to the window to get rid of her
tears unperceived.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; cried she,
&lsquo;there is some one in the garden!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man!&rsquo; screamed Ada&mdash;&lsquo;a thief, a
robber&mdash;call somebody!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Phyllis, laughing, &lsquo;it is
only William; he has been out all the evening, and now papa has
come out to speak to him, and they are walking up and down
together.&nbsp; I wonder whether he has been sitting with Cousin
Robert or at Broomhill!&nbsp; Well, good-night, Ada.&nbsp; Here
comes Hannah.&rsquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE THIRTIETH OF JULY</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The heir, with roses in his shoes,<br />
That night might village partner choose.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> 30th of July was bright and
clear, and Phyllis was up early, gathering flowers, which, with
the help of Jane&rsquo;s nimble fingers, she made into elegant
little bouquets for each of her sisters, and for Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is this?&rsquo; said Mr. Hawkesworth, pretending to
look disconsolate, &lsquo;am I to sing &ldquo;Fair Phyllida
flouts me,&rdquo; or why is my button-hole left
destitute?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps that is for you on the side-table,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! no,&rsquo; said Phyllis, &lsquo;those are some
Provence roses for Miss Weston and Marianne, because Miss Weston
likes those, and they have none at Broomhill.&nbsp; Redgie is
going to take care of them.&nbsp; I will get you a nosegay,
Frank.&nbsp; I did not know you liked it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She started up.&nbsp; &lsquo;How prudent, Phyllis,&rsquo; said
Eleanor, &lsquo;not to have put on your muslin frock
yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I am not going,&rsquo; said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not going!&rsquo; was the general outcry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, poor Ada cries so about being left at home with
only baby, that I cannot bear it, and so I promised to
stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Away went Phyllis, and Reginald exclaimed, &lsquo;Well, she
shall not be served so.&nbsp; I will go and tell Ada so this
instant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Off he rushed, and putting in his head at the nursery door,
shouted, &lsquo;Ada, I am come to tell you that Phyl is not to be
made your black-a-moor slave!&nbsp; She shall go, that is
settled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Down he went with equal speed, without waiting for an answer,
and arrived while Eleanor was saying that she thought Ada was
provided with amusement with the baby, her playthings, and books,
and that Mr. Devereux had promised to make her a visit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anybody ought to stay at home rather than
Phyllis,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;I think I had better
stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Lily,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;you are more
wanted than I am; you are really worth talking to and dancing
with; I had much better be at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgot!&rsquo; exclaimed William.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs.
Weston desired me to say that she is not going, and she will take
care of Ada.&nbsp; Mr. Weston will set her down at half-past ten,
and take up one of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will be that one,&rsquo; said Reginald, &lsquo;I have
not seen Miss Weston since I came home.&nbsp; I meant to walk to
Broomhill after dinner yesterday, only the Baron stopped me about
that country-dance.&nbsp; Last Christmas I made her promise to
dance with me to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily had hoped to be that one, but she did not oppose
Reginald, and turned to listen to Eleanor, who was saying,
&lsquo;Let us clearly understand how every one is to go, it will
save a great deal of confusion.&nbsp; You and Jane, and Maurice,
go in the phaeton, do not you?&nbsp; And who drives
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;William, I believe,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Claude goes earlier, so he rides the gray.&nbsp; Then
there is the chariot for you and Frank, and papa and
Phyllis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So it was proposed, but matters turned out otherwise.&nbsp;
The phaeton, which, with a promoted cart-horse, was rather a slow
conveyance, was to set out first, but the whole of the freight
was not ready in time.&nbsp; The ladies were in the hall as soon
as it came to the door, but neither of the gentlemen were
forthcoming.&nbsp; Reginald, who was wandering in the hall, was
sent to summon them; but down he came in great wrath.&nbsp;
Maurice had declared that he was not ready, and they must wait
for him till he had tied his neckcloth, which Reginald opined
would take three quarters of an hour, as he was doing it
scientifically, and William had said that he was not going in the
gig at all, that he had told Wat Greenwood to drive, and that
Reginald must go instead of Maurice.</p>
<p>In confirmation of the startling fact Wat, who had had a
special invitation from the Marquis, was sitting in the phaeton
in his best black velvet coat.&nbsp; Jane only hoped that Emily
would not look out of the window, or she would certainly go into
fits on seeing them arrive with the old phaeton, the thick-legged
cart-horse, and Wat Greenwood for a driver; and Reginald, after
much growling at Maurice, much bawling at William&rsquo;s door,
and, as Jane said, romping and roaring in all parts of the house,
was forced to be resigned to his fate, and all the way to
Hetherington held a very amusing conversation with his
good-natured friend the keeper.</p>
<p>They were overtaken, nodded to, and passed by the rest of
their party.&nbsp; Maurice had been reduced to ride the pony,
William came with the Westons, and the chariot load was just as
had been before arranged.</p>
<p>Claude came out to meet them at the door, saying, &lsquo;I
need not have gone so early.&nbsp; What do you think has become
of the hero of the day?&nbsp; Guess, I will just give you this
hint,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though on pleasure he was bent, he had no
selfish mind.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! the Aylmers, I suppose,&rsquo; said Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right, Lily, he heard something at dinner yesterday
about a school for clergymen&rsquo;s sons, which struck him as
likely to suit young Devereux Aylmer, and off he set at seven
o&rsquo;clock this morning to Raynham, to breakfast with Mrs.
Aylmer, and talk to her about it.&nbsp; Never let me hear again
that he is engrossed with his own affairs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why is he in such a hurry?&rsquo; asked Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis his nature,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;besides Travers, who mentioned this school, goes away
to-morrow.&nbsp; My aunt is in a fine fright lest he should not
come back in time.&nbsp; Did not you hear her telling papa so in
the drawing-room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There he is, riding up to the door,&rsquo; said
Phyllis, who had joined them in the hall.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood
stopped for a few moments at the door to give some directions to
the servants, and then came quickly in.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, there
you are!&mdash;What time is it?&nbsp; It is all right,
Claude&mdash;Devereux is just the right age.&nbsp; I asked him a
few questions this morning, and he will stand a capital
examination.&nbsp; Ha, Phyl, I am glad to see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you many happy returns of the day, Cousin
Rotherwood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Phyl, we had better see how we get through
one such day before we wish it to return.&nbsp; Are the rest
come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went on into the drawing-room, and hastily informing his
mother that he had sent the carriage to fetch Miss Aylmer and her
brothers to the feast, called Claude to come out on the lawn to
look at the preparations.&nbsp; The bowling-green was to serve as
drawing-room, and at one end was pitched an immense tent where
the dinner was to be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, Claude,&rsquo; said he in his quickest and most
confused way, &lsquo;I depend upon you for one thing.&nbsp; Do
not let the Baron be too near me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Baron of Beef?&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, the Baron of Beechcroft.&nbsp; If you wish my
speech to be <i>radara tadara</i>, put him where I can imagine
that he hears me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Claude, laughing; &lsquo;have
you any other commands?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;yes, I have though.&nbsp; You know what we
settled about the toasts.&nbsp; Hunt up old Farmer Elderfield as
soon as he comes, and do not frighten him.&nbsp; If you could sit
next to him and make him get up at the right time, it would be
best.&nbsp; Tell him I will not let any one propose my health but
my great-grandfather&rsquo;s tenant.&nbsp; You will manage it
best.&nbsp; And tell Frank Hawkesworth, and Mr. Weston, or some
of them, to manage so that the gentry may not sit together in a
herd, two or three together would be best.&nbsp; Mind, Claude, I
depend on you for being attentive to all the damsels.&nbsp; I
cannot be everywhere at once, and I see your great Captain will
be of no use to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here news was brought that the labourers had begun to arrive,
and the party went to the walnut avenue, where the feast was
spread.&nbsp; It was pleasant to see so many poor families
enjoying their excellent dinner; but perhaps the pleasantest
sight was the lord of the feast speaking to each poor man with
all his bright good-natured cordiality.&nbsp; Mr. Mohun was
surprised to see how well he knew them all, considering how short
a time he had been among them, and Lilias found Florence rise in
her estimation, when she perceived that the inside of the
Hetherington cottages were not unknown to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know, Florence,&rsquo; said she, as they walked
back to the house together, &lsquo;I did you great
injustice?&nbsp; I never expected you to know or care about poor
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more I did till this winter,&rsquo; said Florence;
&lsquo;I could not do anything, you know, before.&nbsp; Indeed, I
do not do much now, only Rotherwood has made me go into the
school now and then; and when first we came, he made it his
especial request that whenever a poor woman came to ask for
anything I would go and speak to her.&nbsp; And so I could not
help being interested about those I knew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How odd it is that we never talked about it,&rsquo;
said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never talk of it,&rsquo; said Florence,
&lsquo;because mamma never likes to hear of my going into
cottages with Rotherwood.&nbsp; Besides, somehow I thought you
did it as a matter of duty, and not of pleasure.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;
Rotherwood, is that you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Aylmers are come,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood,
drawing her arm into his, &lsquo;and I want you to come and speak
to them, Florence and Lily; I can&rsquo;t find any one; all the
great elders have vanished.&nbsp; You know them of old, do not
you, Lily?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of old?&nbsp; Yes; but of so old that I do not suppose
they will know me.&nbsp; You must introduce me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He hastened them to the drawing-room, where they found Miss
Aylmer, a sensible, lady-like looking person, and two brothers,
of about fifteen and thirteen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Miss Aylmer, I have brought you two old friends;
so old, that they think you have forgotten them&mdash;my cousin
Lilias, and my sister Florence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have not forgotten you, Miss Aylmer,&rsquo; said
Florence, warmly shaking hands with her.&nbsp; &lsquo;You seem so
entirely to belong to Hetherington that I scarcely knew the place
without you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was something that particularly pleased Lily in the
manner in which Miss Aylmer answered.&nbsp; Florence talked a
little while, and then proposed to adjourn to the supplementary
drawing-room&mdash;the lawn&mdash;where the company were already
assembling.</p>
<p>Florence was soon called off to receive some other guest, and
Lilias spent a considerable time in sitting under a tree talking
to Miss Aylmer, whom she found exceedingly pleasant and
agreeable, remembering all that had happened during their former
intercourse, and interested in everything that was going
on.&nbsp; Lily was much amused when her companion asked her who
that gentleman was&mdash;&lsquo;that tall, thin young man, with
dark hair, whom she had seen once or twice speaking to Lord
Rotherwood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tall gentleman advanced, spoke to Miss Aylmer, told Lily
that the world was verging towards the tent, and giving one arm
to her and the other to Miss Aylmer, took that direction.&nbsp;
In the meantime Phyllis had been walking about with her eldest
sister, and wondering what had become of all the others.&nbsp; In
process of time she found herself seated on a high bench in the
tent, with a most beautiful pink-and-white sugar temple on the
table before her.&nbsp; She was between Eleanor and Frank.&nbsp;
All along one side of the table was a row of faces which she had
never seen before, and she gazed at them in search of some
well-known countenance.&nbsp; At last Mr. Weston caught her eye,
and nodded to her.&nbsp; Next to him she saw Marianne, then
Reginald; on the other side Alethea and William.&nbsp; A little
tranquillised by seeing that every one was not lost, she had
courage to eat some cold chicken, to talk to Frank about the
sugar temple, and to make an inventory in her mind of the
smartest bonnets for Ada&rsquo;s benefit.&nbsp; She was rather
unhappy at not having found out when grace was said before
dinner, and she made Eleanor promise to tell her in time to stand
up after dinner.&nbsp; She could not, however, hear much, though
warned in time, and by this time more at ease and rather enjoying
herself than otherwise.&nbsp; Now Eleanor told her to listen, for
Cousin Rotherwood was going to speak.&nbsp; She listened, but
knew not what was said, until Mr. Hawkesworth told her it was
Church and Queen.&nbsp; What Church and Queen had to do with
Cousin Rotherwood&rsquo;s birthday she could not imagine, and she
laid it up in her mind to ask Claude.&nbsp; The next time she was
told to listen she managed to hear more.&nbsp; By the help of
Eleanor&rsquo;s directions, she found out the speaker, an aged
farmer, in a drab greatcoat, his head bald, excepting a little
silky white hair, which fell over the collar of his coat.&nbsp;
It was Mr. Elderfield, the oldest tenant on the estate, and he
was saying in a slow deliberate tone that he was told he was to
propose his lordship&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; It was a great honour
for the like of him, and his lordship must excuse him if he did
not make a fine speech.&nbsp; All he could say was, that he had
lived eighty-three years on the estate, and held his farm nearly
sixty years; he had seen three marquises of Rotherwood besides
his present lordship, and he had always found them very good
landlords.&nbsp; He hoped and believed his lordship was like his
fathers, and he was sure he could do no better than tread in
their steps.&nbsp; He proposed the health of Lord Rotherwood, and
many happy returns of the day to him.</p>
<p>The simplicity and earnestness of the old man&rsquo;s tones
were appreciated by all, and the tremendous cheer, which almost
terrified Phyllis, was a fit assent to the hearty good wishes of
the old farmer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now comes the trial!&rsquo; whispered Claude to Lilias,
after he had vehemently contributed his proportion to the
noise.&nbsp; Lilias saw that his colour had risen, as much as if
he had to make a speech himself, and he earnestly examined the
coronet on his fork, while every other eye was fixed on the
Marquis.&nbsp; Eloquence was not to be expected; but, at least,
Lord Rotherwood spoke clearly and distinctly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you must not expect
much of a speech from me; I can only thank you for your kindness,
say how glad I am to see you here, and tell you of my earnest
desire that I may not prove myself unworthy to be compared with
my forefathers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here was a pause.&nbsp;
Claude&rsquo;s hand shook, and Lily saw how anxious he was, but
in another moment the Marquis went on smoothly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,
I must ask you to drink the health of a gentleman who has done
his utmost to compensate for the loss which we sustained nine
years ago, and to whom I owe any good intentions which I may
bring to the management of this property.&nbsp; I beg leave to
propose the health of my uncle, Mr. Mohun, of
Beechcroft.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude was much surprised, for his cousin had never given him
a hint of his intention.&nbsp; It was a moment of great delight
to all the young Mohuns when the cheer rose as loud and hearty as
for the young lord himself, and Phyllis smiled, and wondered,
when she saw her papa rise to make answer.&nbsp; He said that he
could not attempt to answer Lord Rotherwood, as he had not heard
what he said, but that he was much gratified by his having
thought of him on this occasion, and by the goodwill which all
had expressed.&nbsp; This was the last speech that was
interesting; Lady Rotherwood&rsquo;s health and a few more toasts
followed, and the party then left the tent for the lawn, where
the cool air was most refreshing, and the last beams of the
evening sun were lighting the tops of the trees.</p>
<p>The dancing was now to begin, and this was the time for Claude
to be useful.&nbsp; He had spent so much time at home, and had
accompanied his father so often in his rides, that he knew every
one, and he was inclined to make every exertion in the cause of
his cousin, and on this occasion seemed to have laid aside his
indolence and disinclination to speak to strangers.</p>
<p>Lady Florence was also indefatigable, darting about, with a
wonderful perception who everybody was, and with whom each would
like to dance.&nbsp; She seized upon little Devereux Aylmer for
her own partner before any one else had time to ask her, and
carried him about the lawn, hunting up and pairing other shy
people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Reginald, what are you about?&nbsp; You can manage
a country-dance.&nbsp; Make haste; where is your
partner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I meant to dance with Miss Weston,&rsquo; said
Reginald, piteously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Weston?&nbsp; Here she is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is only Marianne,&rsquo; said Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Miss Weston is dancing with William.&nbsp;
Marianne, will you accept my apologies for this discourteous
cousin of mine?&nbsp; I am perfectly horror-struck.&nbsp; There,
Redgie, take her with a good grace; you will never have a better
partner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marianne was only too glad to have Reginald presented to her,
ungracious as he was, but the poor little couple met with
numerous disasters.&nbsp; They neither of them knew the way
through a country-dance, and were almost run over every time they
went down the middle; Reginald&rsquo;s heels were very
inconvenient to his neighbours; so much so, that once Claude
thought it expedient to admonish him, that dancing was not merely
an elegant name for football without a ball.&nbsp; Every now and
then some of their friends gave them a hasty intimation that they
were all wrong, but that they knew already but too well.&nbsp; At
last, just when Marianne had turned scarlet with vexation, and
Reginald was growing so desperate that he had thoughts of running
a way, the dance came to an end, and Reginald, with very scanty
politeness to his partner, rushed away to her sister, saying, in
rather a reproachful tone, &lsquo;Miss Weston, you promised to
dance with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not forgotten my promise,&rsquo; said Alethea,
smiling.</p>
<p>At the same moment Claude hurried up, saying, &lsquo;William,
I want a partner for Miss Wilkins, of the Wold Farm.&nbsp; Miss
Wilkins, let me introduce Captain Mohun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see I have made the Captain available,&rsquo; said
Claude, presently after meeting Lord Rotherwood, as he speeded
across the lawn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you?&nbsp; I did not think him fair game,&rsquo;
said the Marquis.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is your heroine,
Claude?&nbsp; I have not seen her dancing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What heroine?&nbsp; What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honest Phyl, of course.&nbsp; Did you think I meant
Miss Weston?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With Eleanor, somewhere.&nbsp; Is the next dance a
quadrille?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Rotherwood ran up the bank to the terraced walks, where
the undancing part of the company sat or walked about.&nbsp; Soon
he spied Phyllis standing by Eleanor, looking rather
wearied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Phyllis, can you dance a
quadrille?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis opened her eyes, and Eleanor desired her to
answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Phyllis, let me see what M. Le Roi has done for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He led her away, wondering greatly, and thinking how very
good-natured Cousin Rotherwood was.</p>
<p>Emily was much surprised to find Phyllis her <i>vis &agrave;
vis</i>.&nbsp; Emily was very generally known and liked, and had
no lack of grand partners, but she would have liked to dance with
the Marquis.&nbsp; When the quadrille was over, she was glad to
put herself in his way, by coming up to take charge of
Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, Phyl,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;no
mistakes.&nbsp; You must have another dance.&nbsp; Whom shall we
find for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Rotherwood,&rsquo; said Emily, &lsquo;you cannot
think how you gratified us all with your speech.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I always set my heart on saying something of the
kind; but I wished I could have dared to add the bride&rsquo;s
health.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bride!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not pretend to have no eyes,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood, with a significant glance, which directed
Emily&rsquo;s eyes to the terrace, where Mr. Mohun and Alethea
were walking together in eager conversation.</p>
<p>Emily was ready to sink into the earth.&nbsp; Jane&rsquo;s
surmises, and the mysterious words of her father, left her no
further doubt.&nbsp; At this moment some one asked her to dance,
and scarcely knowing what she did or said, she walked to her
place.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood now found a partner for Phyllis, and
a farmer&rsquo;s daughter for himself.</p>
<p>This dance over, Phyllis&rsquo;s partner did not well know how
to dispose of her, and she grew rather frightened on finding that
none of her sisters were in sight.&nbsp; At last she perceived
Reginald standing on the bank, and made her escape to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Redgie, did you see who I have been dancing with?&nbsp;
Cousin Rotherwood and Claude&rsquo;s grand Oxford
friend&mdash;Mr. Travers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all nonsense,&rsquo; said Reginald.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come out of this mob of people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But where is Eleanor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somewhere in the midst.&nbsp; They are all absurd
together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter, Redgie?&rsquo; asked Phyllis,
unable to account for this extraordinary fit of misanthropy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa and William both driving me about like a
dog,&rsquo; said Reginald; &lsquo;first I danced with Miss
Weston&mdash;then she saw that woman&mdash;that Miss
Aylmer&mdash;shook hands&mdash;talked&mdash;and then nothing
would serve her but to find papa.&nbsp; As soon as the Baron sees
me he cries out, &ldquo;Why are not you dancing, Redgie?&nbsp; We
do not want you!&rdquo;&nbsp; Up and down they walk, ever so
long, and presently papa turns off, and begins talking to Miss
Aylmer.&nbsp; Then, of course, I went back to Miss Weston, but
then up comes William, as savage as one of his Canadian bears; he
orders me off too, and so here I am!&nbsp; I am sure I am not
going to ask any one else to dance.&nbsp; Come and walk with me
in peace, Phyl.&nbsp; Do you see them?&mdash;Miss Weston and
Marianne under that tulip-tree, and the Captain helping them to
ice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Redgie, did you give Miss Weston her nosegay?&nbsp;
Some one put such beautiful flowers in it, such as I never saw
before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could I?&nbsp; They sent me off with Lily and
Jane.&nbsp; I told William I had the flowers in charge, and he
said he would take care of them.&nbsp; By the bye, Phyl,&rsquo;
and Reginald gave a wondrous spring, &lsquo;I have it!&nbsp; I
have it!&nbsp; I have it!&nbsp; If he is not in love with Miss
Weston you may call me an ass for the rest of my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should not like to call you an ass, Redgie,&rsquo;
said Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely; but do not make me call you one.&nbsp;
Hurrah!&nbsp; Now ask Marianne if it is not so.&nbsp; Marianne
must know.&nbsp; How jolly!&nbsp; I say, Phyl, stay there, and I
will fetch Marianne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Away ran Reginald, and presently returned with Marianne, who
was very glad to be invited to join Phyllis.&nbsp; She little
knew what an examination awaited her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marianne,&rsquo; began Phyllis, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you what&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I will do it right,&rsquo; said Reginald;
&lsquo;you know nothing about it, Phyl.&nbsp; Marianne, is not
something going on there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going on?&rsquo; said Marianne, &lsquo;Alethea is
speaking to Mrs. Hawkesworth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, I know better, Marianne.&nbsp; I have a
suspicion that I could tell what the Captain was about yesterday
when he walked off after dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How very wise you think you look, Reginald!&rsquo; said
Marianne, laughing heartily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But tell us; do tell us, Marianne,&rsquo; said
Phyllis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell you whet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether William is going to marry Miss Weston,&rsquo;
said the straightforward Phyllis.&nbsp; &lsquo;Redgie says
so&mdash;only tell us.&nbsp; Oh! it would be so nice!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How you blurt it out, Phyl,&rsquo; said Reginald.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You do not know how those things are managed.&nbsp; Mind,
I found it out all myself.&nbsp; Just say, Marianne.&nbsp; Am not
I right?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know whether I ought to tell,&rsquo; said
Marianne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! then it is all right,&rsquo; said Reginald,
&lsquo;and I found it out.&nbsp; Now, Marianne, there is a good
girl, tell us all about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know I could not say &ldquo;No&rdquo; when you
asked me,&rsquo; said Marianne; &lsquo;I could not help it
really; but pray do not tell anybody, or Captain Mohun will not
like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does any one know?&rsquo; said Reginald.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only ourselves and Mr. Mohun; and I think Lord
Rotherwood guesses, from something I heard him say to
Jane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Jane?&rsquo; said Reginald.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is
provoking; she will think she found it out all herself, and be so
conceited!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need not be afraid,&rsquo; said Marianne, laughing;
&lsquo;Jane is on a wrong scent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane?&nbsp; Oh! I should like to see her out in her
reckonings!&nbsp; I should like to have a laugh against
her.&nbsp; What does she think, Marianne?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I cannot tell you; it is too bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! do; do, pray.&nbsp; You may whisper it if it is too
bad for Phyllis to hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Marianne; &lsquo;it is nothing but
nonsense.&nbsp; If you hear it, Phyllis shall too; but mind, you
must promise not to say anything to anybody, or I do not know
what will become of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we will not,&rsquo; said Reginald; &lsquo;boys
can always keep secrets, and I&rsquo;ll engage for Phyl.&nbsp;
Now for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is in a terrible fright lest it should be Mr.
Mohun.&nbsp; She got it into her head last autumn, and all I
could say would not persuade her out of it.&nbsp; Why, she always
calls me Aunt Marianne when we are alone.&nbsp; Now, Reginald,
here comes Maurice.&nbsp; Do not say anything, I beg and
entreat.&nbsp; It is my secret, you know.&nbsp; I daresay you
will all be told to-morrow,&mdash;indeed, mamma said
so,&mdash;but pray say nothing about me or Jane.&nbsp; It was
only settled yesterday evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Maurice came up, with a message that Miss
Weston and Eleanor were going away, and wanted the little
girls.&nbsp; They followed him to the tent, which had been
cleared of the tables, and lighted up, in order that the dancing
might continue there.&nbsp; Most of their own party were
collected at the entrance, watching for them.&nbsp; Lilias came
up just as they did, and exclaimed in a tone of disappointment,
on finding them preparing to depart.&nbsp; She had enjoyed
herself exceedingly, found plenty of partners, and was not in the
least tired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should she not stay?&rsquo; said William.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Claude has engaged to stay to the end of everything, and
he may as well drive her as ride the gray.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, Jenny,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;do you
like to stay or go?&nbsp; Alethea will make room for you in the
pony-carriage, or you may go with Eleanor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With Eleanor, if you please,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Already, Jane?&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you
tired?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane drew her aside.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tired of hearing that I was
right about what you would not believe.&nbsp; Did you not hear
what he called her?&nbsp; And Rotherwood has found it
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all gossip and mistake,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>Here Jane was called away by Eleanor, and departed with her;
Lilias went to look for her aunt or Florence, but on the way was
asked to dance by Mr. Carrington.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I may congratulate you,&rsquo; said he in one
of the pauses in the quadrille.</p>
<p>Lily thought it best to misunderstand, and answered,
&lsquo;Everything has gone off very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood will be a popular man; but
my congratulations refer to something nearer home.&nbsp; I think
you owe us some thanks for having brought them into the
neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Report is very kind in making arrangements,&rsquo; said
Lily, with something of Emily&rsquo;s haughty courtesy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope this is something more than report,&rsquo; said
her partner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I believe not.&nbsp; I think I may safely say
that it is at present quite unfounded,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>Mr. Carrington, much surprised, said no more.</p>
<p>Lily did not believe the report sufficiently to be annoyed by
it during the excitement and pleasure of the evening, and at
present her principal vexation was caused by the rapid diminution
of the company.&nbsp; She and her brother were the very last to
depart, even Florence had gone to bed, and Lady Rotherwood,
looking exceedingly tired, kissed Lily at the foot of the stairs,
pitied her for going home in an open carriage, and wished her
good-night in a very weary tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think you were the fiftieth lady I have handed
across the hall,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood, as he gave Lily his
arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But where were the fireworks, Rotherwood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Countermanded long ago.&nbsp; We have had enough of
them.&nbsp; Well, I am sorry it is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very glad it is so well over,&rsquo; said
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks to your exertions, Claude,&rsquo; said the
Marquis.&nbsp; &lsquo;You acted like a hero.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like a dancing dervish you mean,&rsquo; said
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will suffice for my whole
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you are not quite exhausted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you.&nbsp; I have turned over a new
leaf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Talking of new leaves,&rsquo; said the Marquis,
&lsquo;I always had a presentiment that Emily&rsquo;s government
would come to a crisis to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think it has?&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trust my word, you will hear great news
to-morrow.&nbsp; And that reminds me&mdash;can you come here
to-morrow morning?&nbsp; Travers is going&mdash;I drive him to
meet the coach at the town, and you were talking of wanting to
see the new windows in the cathedral: it will be a good
opportunity.&nbsp; And dine here afterwards to talk over the
adventures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you&mdash;that last I cannot do.&nbsp; The Baron
was saying it would be the first time of having us all
together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, besides the great news.&nbsp; I wish I was
going back with you; it is a tame conclusion, only to go to
bed.&nbsp; If I was but to be on the scene of action
to-morrow.&nbsp; Tell the Baron that&mdash;no, use your influence
to get me invited to dinner on Saturday&mdash;I really want to
speak to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Claude, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do my
best.&nbsp; Good-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; said the Marquis.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have both done wonders.&nbsp; Still, I wish it was to come over
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Few people would say so,&rsquo; said Lily, as they
drove off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Few would say so if they thought so,&rsquo; said
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been quite admiring the way
Rotherwood has gone on&mdash;enjoying the fun as if he was
nobody&mdash;just as Reginald might, making other people happy,
and making no secret of his satisfaction in it all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very free from affectation and nonsense,&rsquo; said
Lily, &lsquo;as William said of him last Christmas.&nbsp; You
were in a fine fright about his speech, Claude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More than I ought to have been.&nbsp; I should have
known that he is too simple-minded and straightforward to say
anything but just what he ought.&nbsp; What a nice person that
Miss Aylmer is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is not she, Claude?&nbsp; I was very glad you had her
for a neighbour.&nbsp; Happy the children who have her for a
governess.&nbsp; How sensible and gentle she seems.&nbsp; The
Westons&mdash;But oh!&nbsp; Claude, tell me one thing, did you
hear&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am ashamed to say.&nbsp; That preposterous report
about papa.&nbsp; Why, Rotherwood himself seems to believe it,
and Mr. Carrington began to congratulate&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The public has bestowed so many ladies on the Baron,
that I wonder it is not tired,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is time it should patronise William instead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rotherwood is not the public,&rsquo; said Lily,
&lsquo;and he is the last person to say anything impertinent of
papa.&nbsp; And I myself heard papa call her Alethea, which he
never used to do.&nbsp; Claude, what do you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a long pause Claude slowly replied, &lsquo;Think?&nbsp;
Why, I think Miss Weston must be a person of great courage.&nbsp;
She begins the world as a grandmother, to say nothing of her
eldest daughter and son being considerably her
seniors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not believe it,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do
you, Claude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot make up my mind&mdash;it is too amazing.&nbsp;
My hair is still standing on end.&nbsp; When it comes down I may
be able to tell you something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such were the only answers that Lily could extract from
him.&nbsp; He did not sufficiently disbelieve the report to treat
it with scorn, yet he did not sufficiently credit it to resign
himself to such a state of things.</p>
<p>On coming home Lily found Emily and Jane in her room, eagerly
discussing the circumstances which, to their prejudiced eyes,
seemed strong confirmation.&nbsp; While their tongues were in
full career the door opened and Eleanor appeared.&nbsp; She told
them it was twelve o&rsquo;clock, turned Jane out of the room,
and made Emily and Lily promise not to utter another syllable
that night.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE CRISIS</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Is this your care of the
nest?&rdquo; cried he,<br />
&ldquo;It comes of your gadding abroad,&rdquo; said
she.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the consternation of the
disconsolate damsels, the first news they heard the next morning
was that Mr. Mohun was gone to breakfast at Broomhill, and the
intelligence was received by Frank Hawkesworth with a smile which
they thought perfectly malicious.&nbsp; Frank, William, and
Reginald talked a little at breakfast about the
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>, but no one joined them, and Claude looked so
grave that Eleanor was convinced that he had a headache, and
vainly tried to persuade him to stay at home, instead of setting
off to Devereux Castle immediately after breakfast.</p>
<p>The past day had not been spent in vain by Ada.&nbsp; Mrs.
Weston had led her by degrees to open her heart to her, had made
her perceive the real cause of her father&rsquo;s displeasure,
see her faults, and promise to confess them, a promise which she
performed with many tears, as soon as she saw Eleanor in the
morning.</p>
<p>On telling this to Emily Eleanor was surprised to find that
she was not listened to with much satisfaction.&nbsp; Emily
seemed to think it a piece of interference on the part of Mrs.
Weston, and would not allow that it was likely to be the
beginning of improvement in Ada.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The words were put into her mouth,&rsquo; said she;
&lsquo;and they were an easy way of escaping from her present
state of disgrace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary,&rsquo; said Eleanor, &lsquo;she seemed
to think that she justly deserved to be in disgrace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you think so?&rsquo; said Emily, in a careless
tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are in a strange mood to-day, Emily,&rsquo; said
Eleanor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I?&nbsp; I did not know it.&nbsp; I wonder where
Lily is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily was in her own room, teaching Phyllis.&nbsp; Phyllis was
rather wild and flighty that morning, scarcely able to command
her attention, and every now and then bursting into an
irrepressible fit of laughter.&nbsp; Reginald and Phyllis found
it most difficult to avoid betraying Marianne, and as soon as
luncheon was over, they agreed to set out on a long expedition
into the woods, where they might enjoy their wonderful secret
together.&nbsp; Just at this time Mr. Mohun returned.&nbsp; He
came into the drawing-room, and Lilias, perceiving that the
threatened conversation with Emily was about to take place, made
her escape to her own room, whither she was presently followed by
Jane, who could not help running after her to report the great
news that Emily was to be deposed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure of it,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
sent me out of the room, but not before I had seen certain
symptoms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very hard that poor Emily should bear all the
blame,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have managed to escape it very well,&rsquo; said
Jane, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have all the thanks and
praise.&nbsp; I suppose it is because the intimacy with Miss
Weston was your work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not believe that nonsense,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seeing is believing, they say,&rsquo; said Jane.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Remember, it is not only me.&nbsp; Think of
Rotherwood.&nbsp; And Maurice guesses it too, and Redgie told him
great things were going on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While Jane was speaking they heard the drawing-room door open,
and in another moment Emily came in.</p>
<p>It was true that, as Jane said, she had been deposed.&nbsp;
Mr. Mohun had begun by saying, &lsquo;Emily, can you bring me
such an account of your expenditure as I desired?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I scarcely think I can, papa,&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am sorry to say that my accounts are rather in
confusion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is to say, that you have been as irregular in the
management of your own affairs as you have in mine.&nbsp; Well, I
have paid your debt to Lilias, and from this time forward I
require of you to reduce your expenses to the sum which I
consider suitable, and which both Eleanor and Lilias have found
perfectly sufficient.&nbsp; And now, Emily, what have you to say
for the management of my affairs?&nbsp; Can you offer any excuse
for your utter failure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, papa, I am very sorry I vexed you,&rsquo; said
Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our illness last autumn&mdash;different
things&mdash;I know all has not been quite as it should be; but I
hope that in future I shall profit by past experience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;but I am
afraid to trust the management of the family to you any
longer.&nbsp; Your trial is over, and you have failed, merely
because you would not exert yourself from wilful indolence and
negligence.&nbsp; You have not attended to any one thing
committed to your charge&mdash;you have placed temptation in
Esther&rsquo;s way&mdash;and allowed Ada to take up habits which
will not be easily corrected.&nbsp; I should not think myself
justified in leaving you in charge any longer, lest worse
mischief should ensue.&nbsp; I wish you to give up the keys to
Eleanor for the present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mohun would perhaps have added something if Emily had
shown signs of repentance, or even of sorrow.&nbsp; The moment
was at least as painful to him as to her, and he had prepared
himself to expect either hysterical tears, with vows of
amendment, or else an argument on her side that she was right and
everybody else wrong.&nbsp; But there was nothing of the kind;
Emily neither spoke nor looked; she only carried the tokens of
her authority to Eleanor, and left the room.&nbsp; She thought
she knew well enough the cause of her deposition, considered it
quite as a matter of course, and departed on purpose to avoid
hearing the announcement which she expected to follow.</p>
<p>She was annoyed by finding her sisters in her room, and
especially irritated by Jane&rsquo;s tone, as she eagerly asked,
&lsquo;Well, what did he say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; replied Emily, pettishly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it about Miss Weston?&rsquo; persisted Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not actually, but I saw it was coming,&rsquo; said
Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;I was just telling Lily
that she owes all her present favour to her having been
Alethea&rsquo;s bosom friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I confess I thought Miss Weston was assuming authority
long ago,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily, how can you say so?&rsquo; cried Lily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How can you be so unjust and ungrateful?&nbsp; I do not
believe this report; but if it should be true, are not these
foolish expressions of dislike so many attempts to make yourself
undutiful?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have rather more sincerity, more dignity, more
attachment to my own mother, than to try to gain favour by
affecting what I do not feel,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather cutting, Emily,&rsquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not give that speech an application which Emily did
not intend,&rsquo; said Lily, sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What makes you think I did not intend it?&rsquo; said
Emily, coldly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily!&rsquo; exclaimed Lily, starting up, and
colouring violently, &lsquo;are you thinking what you are
saying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know what you mean,&rsquo; replied Emily
quietly, in her soft, unchanging voice; &lsquo;I only mean that
if you can feel satisfied with the new arrangement you are more
easily pleased than I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only tell me, Emily, do you accuse me of attempting to
gain favour in an unworthy manner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only congratulate you on standing so well with every
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily hid her face in her hands.&nbsp; At this moment Eleanor
opened the door, saying, &lsquo;Can you come down?&nbsp; Mrs.
Burnet is here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Eleanor went without observing Lily,
and Emily was obliged to follow.&nbsp; Jane lingered in order to
comfort Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know she did not quite mean it,&rsquo; said she;
&lsquo;she is only very much provoked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know, I know,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;she is very
sorry herself by this time.&nbsp; Of course she did not mean it,
but it is the first unkind thing she ever said to me.&nbsp; It is
very silly, and very unjust to take it seriously, but I cannot
help it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a very abominable shame,&rsquo; said Jane,
&lsquo;and so I shall tell Emily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, do not, Jenny, I beg.&nbsp; I know she thinks so
herself, and grieves too much over it.&nbsp; No wonder she is
vexed.&nbsp; All my faults have come upon her.&nbsp; You had
better go down, Jane; Mrs. Burnet is always vexed if she does not
see a good many of us, and I am sure I cannot go.&nbsp; Besides,
Emily dislikes having that girl to entertain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lily, you are so very gentle and forgiving, that I
wonder how any one can say what grieves you,&rsquo; said Jane,
for once struck with admiration.</p>
<p>She went, and Lily remained, weeping over the injustice which
she had forgiven, and feeling as if, all the time, it was fair
that the rule of &lsquo;love&rsquo; should, as it were, recoil
upon her.&nbsp; Her tears flowed fast, as she went over the long
line of faults and follies which lay heavy on her
conscience.&nbsp; And Emily against her!&nbsp; That sister who,
from her infancy, had soothed her in every trouble, of whose
sympathy she had always felt sure, whose gentleness had been her
admiration in her days of sharp answers and violent temper, who
had seemed her own beyond all the others; this wound from her
gave Lily a bitter feeling of desertion and loneliness.&nbsp; It
was like a completion of her punishment&mdash;the broken reed on
which she leant had pierced her deeply.</p>
<p>She was still sitting on the side of her bed, weeping, when a
slight tap at the door made her start&mdash;a gentle tap, the
sound of which she had learned to love in her illness.&nbsp; The
next moment Alethea stood before her, with outstretched
arms.&nbsp; This was a time to feel the value of such a friend,
and every suspicion passing from her mind, she flew to Alethea,
kissed her again and again, and laid her head on her
shoulder.&nbsp; Her caress was returned with equal warmth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how is this?&rsquo; said Alethea, now perceiving
that her face was pale, and marked by tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;How is
this, my dear Lily?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Alethea!&nbsp; I cannot tell you, but it is all
misery.&nbsp; The full effect of my baneful principle has
appeared!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has anything happened?&rsquo; exclaimed Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Lily.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is nothing
new, except the&mdash;Oh!&nbsp; I cannot tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could do anything for you, my poor
Lily,&rsquo; said Alethea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can look kind,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;and that is
a great comfort.&nbsp; Oh! Alethea, it was very kind of you to
come and speak to me.&nbsp; I shall do now&mdash;I can bear it
all better.&nbsp; You have a comforting face and voice like
nobody else.&nbsp; When did you come?&nbsp; Have you been in the
drawing-room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Alethea.&nbsp; &lsquo;I walked here
with Marianne, and finding there were visitors in the
drawing-room we went to Ada, and she told me where to find
you.&nbsp; I had something to tell you&mdash;but perhaps you know
already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The colour on her cheek recalled all Lily&rsquo;s fears, and
to hear the news from herself was an unexpected trial.&nbsp; She
felt as if what she had said justified Emily&rsquo;s reproach,
and turning away her head, replied, &lsquo;Yes, I
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alethea was a little hurt by her coldness, but she ascribed it
to dejection and embarrassment, and blamed herself for hurrying
on what she had to tell without sufficient regard for
Lily&rsquo;s distress.&nbsp; There was an awkward pause, which
Alethea broke, by saying, &lsquo;Your brother thought you would
like to hear it from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brother!&rsquo; cried Lily, with a most sudden
change of tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;William?&nbsp; Oh, Alethea! dearest
Alethea; I beg your pardon.&nbsp; They almost made me believe it
was papa.&nbsp; Oh! I am so very glad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alethea could not help laughing, and Lily joined her
heartily.&nbsp; It was one of the brightest hours of her life, as
she sat with her hand in her friend&rsquo;s, pouring out her
eager expressions of delight and affection.&nbsp; All her
troubles were forgotten&mdash;how should they not, when Alethea
was to be her sister!&nbsp; It seemed as if but a few minutes had
passed, when the sound of the great clock warned Alethea that it
was time to return to Broomhill, and she asked Lilias to walk
back with her.&nbsp; After summoning Marianne, they set out
through the garden, where, on being joined by William, Lily
thought it expedient to betake herself to Marianne, who was but
too glad to be able freely to communicate many interesting
particulars.&nbsp; At Broomhill she had a very enjoyable talk
with Mrs. Weston, but her chief delight was in her walk home with
her brother.&nbsp; She was high in his favour, as Alethea&rsquo;s
chief friend.&nbsp; Though usually reserved, he was now open, and
Lily wondered to find herself honoured with confidence.&nbsp; His
attachment had begun in very early days, when first he knew the
Westons in Brighton.&nbsp; Harry&rsquo;s death had suddenly
called him away, and a few guarded expressions of his wishes in
the course of the next winter had been cut short by his
father.&nbsp; He then went to Canada, and had had no opportunity
of renewing his acquaintance till the last winter, when, on
coming home, to his great joy and surprise he found the Westons
on the most intimate terms with his family.</p>
<p>He then spoke to his father, who wished him to take a little
more time for consideration, and he had accordingly waited till
the summer.&nbsp; Lily longed to know his plans for the future,
and presently he went on to say that his father wished him to
leave the army, live at home, and let Alethea be the head of the
household.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, William! it is perfect.&nbsp; There is an end of
all our troubles.&nbsp; It is as if a great black curtain was
drawn up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They say such plans never succeed,&rsquo; said William;
&lsquo;but we mean to prove the contrary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How good it will be for the children!&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! why had we not such a guide at first?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has all that Eleanor wants,&rsquo; said
William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My follies were not Eleanor&rsquo;s fault,&rsquo; said
Lily; &lsquo;but I do think I should not have been quite so silly
if I had known Alethea from the first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not in the power of William himself to say more in her
praise than Lily.&nbsp; In the eagerness of their conversation
they walked slowly, and as they were crossing the last field the
dinner-bell rang.&nbsp; As they quickened their steps they saw
Mr. Mohun looking at his wheat.&nbsp; Lily told him how late it
was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I am always looking after
other people&rsquo;s affairs.&nbsp; Between Rotherwood and
William I have not a moment for my own crops.&nbsp; However, my
turn is coming.&nbsp; William will have it all on his hands, and
the old deaf useless Baron will sit in his great chair and take
his ease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit, papa,&rsquo; said Lily, &lsquo;the Baron
will grow young, and take to dancing.&nbsp; He is talking
nonsense already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh!&nbsp; Miss Lily turned saucy?&nbsp; Mrs. William
Mohun must take her in hand.&nbsp; Well, Lily, has he your
consent and approbation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only wish this was eighteen months ago,
papa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall soon come into order, Lily.&nbsp; With Miss
Aylmer for the little ones, and Mrs. Mohun for the great ones, I
have little fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Aylmer, papa!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, if all turns out well.&nbsp; We propose to find a
house for her mother in the village, and let her come every day
to teach the little ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I am very glad.&nbsp; We liked her so
much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; said Mr. Mohun, &lsquo;that this plan
will please Claude better than my proposal of a governess last
month.&nbsp; He looked as if he expected Minerva with helmet, and
&AElig;gis and all.&nbsp; Now make haste and dress.&nbsp; Do not
let us shock Eleanor by keeping dinner waiting longer than we can
help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias found that her sisters had long been dressed and gone
down.&nbsp; She dressed alone, every now and then smiling at her
own happy looks reflected in the glass.&nbsp; Just as she had
finished, Claude knocked at the door, and putting in his head,
said, &lsquo;Well, Lily, has the wonderful news come forth?&nbsp;
I see it has, by your face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do you know what it is, Claude?&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what Rotherwood meant, and I cannot think where
all our senses were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, Claude, only say that you like her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it is a very good thing indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only say that you cordially like her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do.&nbsp; I admire her sense and her gentleness very
much, and I think you owe a great deal to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you allow that you were unjust last
summer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do; but it was owing to you.&nbsp; You were somewhat
foolish, and I thought it was her fault.&nbsp; Besides, I was
quite tired of hearing that extraordinary name of hers for ever
repeated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here they were summoned to dinner, and hurried down.&nbsp; The
dinner passed very strangely; some were in very high spirits,
others in a very melancholy mood; Eleanor and Maurice alone
preserved the golden mean; and the behaviour of the merry ones
was perfectly unintelligible to the rest.&nbsp; Reginald, still
bound by his promise to Marianne, was wild to make his discovery
known, and behaved in such a strange and comical manner as to
call forth various reproofs from Eleanor, which provoked double
mirth from the others.&nbsp; The cause of their amusement was
ostensibly the talking over of yesterday&rsquo;s
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>, but the laughing was more than adequate, even
to the wonderful collection of odd speeches and adventures which
were detailed.&nbsp; Emily and Jane could not guess what had come
to Lily, and thought her merriment very ill-placed.&nbsp; Yet, in
justice to Lily, it must be said that her joy no longer made her
wild and thoughtless.&nbsp; There was something guarded and
subdued about her, which made Claude reflect how different she
was from the untamed girl of last summer, who could not be happy
without a sort of intoxication.</p>
<p>The ladies returned to the drawing-room, where Ada now
appeared for the first time, and while they were congratulating
her Mr. Mohun summoned Eleanor away.&nbsp; Jane followed at a
safe distance to see where they went.&nbsp; They shut themselves
into the study, and Jane, now meeting Maurice, went into the
garden with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;It must be coming now,&rsquo; said
she; &lsquo;oh! there are William and Claude talking under the
plane-tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Claude has his cunning smile on,&rsquo; said
Maurice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No wonder,&rsquo; said Jane, &lsquo;it is very
absurd.&nbsp; I daresay William will hardly ever come home
now.&nbsp; One comfort is, they will see I was right from the
first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jane and Maurice remained in the garden till teatime, and thus
missed hearing the whole affair discussed in the drawing-room
between Emily, Lilias, and Frank.&nbsp; This was the first news
that Emily heard of it, and a very great relief it was, for she
could imagine liking, and even loving, Alethea as a
sister-in-law.&nbsp; Her chief annoyance was at present from the
perception of the difference between her own position and that of
Lilias.&nbsp; Last year how was Lily regarded in the family, and
what was her opinion worth?&nbsp; Almost nothing; she was only a
clever, romantic, silly girl, while Emily had credit at least for
discretion.&nbsp; Now Lily was consulted and sought out by
father, brothers, Eleanor&mdash;no longer treated as a
child.&nbsp; And what was Emily?&nbsp; Blamed or pitied on every
side, and left to hear this important news from the chance
mention of her brother-in-law, himself not fully informed.&nbsp;
She had become nobody, and had even lost the satisfaction, such
as it was, of fancying that her father only made her bad
management an excuse for his marriage.&nbsp; She heard many
particulars from Lily in the course of the evening, as they were
going to bed; and the sisters talked with all their wonted
affection, although Emily had not thought it worth while to
revive an old grievance, by asking Lily&rsquo;s pardon for her
unkind speech, and rested satisfied with the knowledge that her
sister knew her heart too well to care for what she said in a
moment of irritation.&nbsp; On the other hand, Lily did not think
that she had a right to mention the plan of Alethea&rsquo;s
government, and the next day she was glad of her reserve, for her
father called her to share his early walk for the purpose of
talking over the scheme, telling her that he thought she
understood the state of things better than Eleanor could, and
that he considered that she had sufficient influence with Emily
to prevent her from making Alethea uncomfortable.&nbsp; The
conclusion of the conversation was, that they thought they might
depend upon Emily&rsquo;s amiability, her courtesy, and her
dislike of trouble, to balance her love of importance and
dignity.&nbsp; And that Alethea would do nothing to hurt her
feelings, and would assume no authority that she could help, they
felt convinced.</p>
<p>After breakfast Mr. Mohun called Emily into his study,
informed her of his resolution, to which she listened with her
usual submissive manner, and told her that he trusted to her good
sense and right feeling to obviate any collisions of authority
which might be unpleasant to Alethea and hurtful to the younger
ones.&nbsp; She promised all that was desired, and though at the
moment she felt hurt and grieved, she almost immediately
recovered her usual spirits, never high, but always serene, and
only seeking for easy amusement and comfort in whatever
happened.&nbsp; There was no public disgrace in her deposition;
it would not seem unnatural to the neighbours that her
brother&rsquo;s wife should be at the head of the house.&nbsp;
She would gain credit for her amiability, and she would no longer
be responsible or obliged to exert herself; and as to Alethea
herself, she could not help respecting and almost loving
her.&nbsp; It was very well it was no worse.</p>
<p>In the meantime Lily, struck by a sudden thought, had hastened
to her mother&rsquo;s little deserted morning-room, to see if it
could not be made a delightful abode for Alethea; and she was
considering of its capabilities when she started at the sound of
an approaching step.&nbsp; It was the rapid and measured tread of
the Captain, and in a few moments he entered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank
you,&rsquo; said he, smiling, &lsquo;you are on the same errand
as myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; said Lily; &lsquo;it will do
capitally; how pretty Long Acre looks, and what a beautiful view
of the church!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This room used once to be pretty,&rsquo; said William,
looking round, disappointed; &lsquo;it is very
forlorn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but it will look very different when the chairs do
not stand with their backs to the wall.&nbsp; I do not think
Alethea knows of this room, for nobody has sat in it for years,
and we will make it a surprise.&nbsp; And here is your own
picture, at ten years old, over the fireplace!&nbsp; I have such
a vision, you will not know the room when I have set it to
rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went on talking eagerly of the improvements that might be
made, and from thence came to other subjects&mdash;Alethea
herself, and the future plans.&nbsp; At last William asked if
Lily knew what made Jane look as deplorable as she had done for
the last two days, and Lily was obliged to tell him, with the
addition that Eleanor had begun to inform her of the real fact,
but that she had stopped her by declaring that she had known it
all from the first.&nbsp; Just as they had mentioned her, Jane,
attracted by the unusual sound of voices in Lady Emily&rsquo;s
room, came in, asking what they could be doing there.&nbsp; Lily
would scarcely have dared to reply, but William said in a grave,
matter-of-fact way, &lsquo;We are thinking of having this room
newly fitted up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For Alethea Weston?&rsquo; said Jane; &lsquo;how can
you, Lily?&nbsp; I should have thought, at least, it was no
laughing matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I advise you to follow Lily&rsquo;s example and make
the best of it,&rsquo; said William.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do, but it is another thing to stand laughing
here.&nbsp; I see one thing that I shall do&mdash;I shall take
away your picture and hang it in my room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall see,&rsquo; said William, following Lilias,
who had left the room to hide her laughter.</p>
<p>To mystify Jane was the great amusement of the day; Reginald,
finding Maurice possessed with the same notion, did more to
maintain it than the others would have thought right, and Maurice
reporting his speeches to Jane, she had not the least doubt that
her idea was correct.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood came to dinner, and
no sooner had he entered the drawing-room than Reginald,
rejoicing in the absence of the parties concerned, informed him
of the joke, much to his diversion, though rather to the
discomfiture of the more prudent spectators, who might have
wished it confined to themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has gone far enough,&rsquo; said Claude; &lsquo;she
will say something she will repent if we do not take
care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to reduce her to humble herself to ask an
explanation from Marianne,&rsquo; said Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pray don&rsquo;t spoil the joke before I have
enjoyed it,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;My years of
discretion are not such centuries of wisdom as those of that
gentleman who looks as grim as his namesake the Emperor on a
coin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The entrance of Eleanor and Jane here put an end to the
conversation, which was not renewed till the evening, when the
younger, or as Claude called it, the middle-aged part of the
company were sitting on the lawn, leaving the drawing-room to the
elder and more prudent, and the terrace to the wilder and more
active.&nbsp; Emily was talking of Mrs. Burnet&rsquo;s visit of
the day before, and her opinion of the Hetherington
festivities.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what an interminable visit it
was,&rsquo; said Jane; &lsquo;I thought they would never
go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;People always inflict themselves in a most merciless
manner when there is anything going on,&rsquo; said Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder if they guessed anything,&rsquo; said
Lily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure they did, and stayed out of
curiosity,&rsquo; said Lord Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;In spite of
Emily&rsquo;s dignified contradictions of the report, every one
knew it the other evening.&nbsp; It was all in vain that she
behaved as if I was speaking treason&mdash;people have
eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I am very sorry for that contradiction,&rsquo; said
Lily; &lsquo;I hope people will not fancy we do not like
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it will only prove my greatness,&rsquo; said Lord
Rotherwood.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your Marques, was China in the map, so
absorbing all beholders that the magnanimous Mohuns
themselves&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What nonsense, Rotherwood,&rsquo; said Jane, sharply;
&lsquo;can&rsquo;t you suppose that one may shut one&rsquo;s eyes
to what one does not wish to see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The singular inappropriateness of this answer occasioned a
general roar of laughter, and she looked in perplexity.&nbsp;
Every one whom she asked why they laughed replied by saying,
&lsquo;Ask Marianne Weston;&rsquo; and at length, after much
puzzling and guessing, and being more laughed at than had ever
before happened to her in her life, she was obliged to seek an
explanation from Marianne, who might well have triumphed had she
been so disposed.&nbsp; Jane&rsquo;s character for penetration
was entirely destroyed, and the next morning she received, as a
present from Claude, an old book, which had long belonged to the
nursery, entitled, <i>A Puzzle for a Curious Girl</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There let Hymen oft appear<br />
In saffron robe, with taper clear,<br />
And pomp, and feast, and revelry,<br />
And mask, and antique pageantry;<br />
Such sights as useful poets dream<br />
On summer eves, by haunted stream.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of a fine day, late
in September, the Beechcroft bells were ringing merrily, and a
wedding procession was entering the gate of the churchyard.</p>
<p>In the afternoon there was a great feast on the top of the
hill, attended by all the Mohuns, who were forced, to
Lily&rsquo;s great satisfaction, to give it there, as there was
no space in the grounds at the New Court.&nbsp; All was
wonderfully suitable to old times, inasmuch as the Baron was
actually persuaded to sit for five minutes under the yew-tree
where &lsquo;Mohun&rsquo;s chair&rsquo; ought to have been, and
the cricketers were of all ranks, from the Marquis of Rotherwood
to little Dick Grey.</p>
<p>The wedding had been hurried on, and the wedding tour was
shortened, in order that Mrs. William Mohun might be installed as
mistress of the New Court before Eleanor&rsquo;s departure, which
took place early in October; and shortly after Mrs. Ridley, who
had come on a visit to Beechcroft, to take leave of her brother,
returned to the north, taking with her the little Harry.&nbsp; He
was nearly a year old, and it gave great pain to his young aunts
to part with him, now that he had endeared himself to them by
many engaging ways, but Lily felt herself too unequal to the task
of training him up to make any objection, and there were many
promises that he should not be a stranger to his
grandfather&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Mrs. and Miss Aylmer had been about a month settled at a
superior sort of cottage, near the New Court, with Mrs. Eden for
their servant.&nbsp; Lord Rotherwood had fitted out the second
son, who sailed for India with Mr. and Mrs. Hawkesworth, had sent
Devereux to school, and was lying in wait to see what could be
done for the two others, and Jane was congratulated far more than
she wished, on having been the means of discovering such an
excellent governess.&nbsp; Jane was now a regular inhabitant of
the schoolroom, as much tied down to lessons and schoolroom hours
as her two little sisters, with the prospect of so continuing for
two years, if not for three.&nbsp; She made one attempt to be
pert to Miss Aylmer; but something in the manner of her governess
quite baffled her, and she was obliged to be more obedient than
she had ever been.&nbsp; The mischief which Emily and Lilias had
done to her, by throwing off their allegiance to Eleanor, and
thus unconsciously leading her to set her at nought, was, at her
age, not to be so easily repaired; yet with no opportunity for
gossiping, and with involuntary respect for her governess, there
were hopes that she would lose the habit of her two great
faults.&nbsp; There certainly was an improvement in her general
tone and manner, which made Mr. Devereux hope that he might soon
resume with her the preparation for confirmation which had been
cut short the year before.</p>
<p>Phyllis and Adeline had been possessed by Reginald with a
great dread of governesses; and they were agreeably surprised in
Miss Aylmer, whom they found neither cross nor strict, and always
willing to forward their amusements, and let them go out with
their papa and sisters whenever they were asked.&nbsp; Phyllis,
without much annoyance to one so obedient, was trained into more
civilisation, and Ada&rsquo;s more serious faults were duly
watched and guarded against.&nbsp; The removal of Esther was a
great advantage to Ada; an older and more steady person was taken
in her place; while to the great relief of Mr. Mohun and Lilias,
Rachel Harvey took Esther to her brother&rsquo;s farmhouse, where
she promised to watch and teach her, and hoped in time to make
her a good servant.</p>
<p>Of Emily there is little to say.&nbsp; She ate, drank, and
slept, talked agreeably, read idle books, and looked nice in the
drawing-room, wasting time, throwing away talents, weakening the
powers of her mind, and laying up a store of sad reflections for
herself against the time when she must awake from her selfish
apathy.</p>
<p>As to Lilias Mohun, the heroine of this tale, the history of
the formation of her character has been told, and all that
remains to be said of her is, that the memory of her faults and
her sorrows did not fleet away like a morning cloud, though
followed by many happy and prosperous days, and though the
effects of many were repaired.&nbsp; Agnes&rsquo;s death,
Esther&rsquo;s theft, Ada&rsquo;s accident, the schism in the
parish, and her own numerous mistakes, were constantly recalled,
and never without a thought of the danger of being wise above her
elders, and taking mere feeling for Christian charity.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
